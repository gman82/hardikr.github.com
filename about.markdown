Hi! I’m Hardik, a web developer, writer and an Arsenal fan. I graduated
from [NIT Trichy][] in 2010, and have been working on my [startup][]
since !

In my free time, I enjoy [programming][], [writing][],
[startups][], [natural language processing][],
[learning][], [technology][], [travelling][], [comedy][], [reading][],
[football][], [music][] and the occasional movie.

Here, I share my opinion on stuff I find important enough to write
about. This blog has comments turned off to avoid normal people turning
into trolls. However, if you wish to have a mature conversation about
anything I write, contact me by clicking [here!][].

*Misc* :   
**1.** You can catch my older and now defunct blog at [A Day Without
Chocolate][], where most of my previous writings are present. They will
stay there and will not be migrated to this blog.  
**2.** To read some of my longer articles, proceed to
[/essays][writing].  
**3.** Programmer? Check out my [experiments][], [tools][] and noob
[.vimrc][].  
**4. **Want to tell me a secret? Use my [public key][] ([mirror 1][],
[mirror 2][]).  
**5. **Looking for inspiration? Do you know about [Soichiro Honda][]?   
**6. **Love science? I’m sure you’ve watched [Richard Feynman][]!  
**7. **Aspiring entrepreneur in India? Check out [L-pad][].   
**8.** Browse some of my random [notes][].  
**9**. Hacker News addict? Check out some [lesser known features][] and
awesome [add-ons][].  
**10. **Fancy computational linguistics? Check out [Dr. V.
Gopalakrishnan’s][] (my college professor) class notes. To download the
notes, enter ‘slpnotes.pdf’ without the quotes on this [page][].
