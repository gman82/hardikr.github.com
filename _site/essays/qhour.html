<h2>Why Indian Entrepreneurs should watch the Question Hour</h2>


<p>Let's face it - We Indians have a pretty poor image of Indian politicians in our heads - wearing the traditional white - they are usually the epitome of uselessness.</p>
<p>Anyway, that's not why you should watch Indian Politicians question and bug each other. Here are 5 reasons why every Indian entrepreneur should give a damn about the Question Hour in the Lok Sabha :</p>
<p>For those who don't know, the Question Hour is a the first hour of sitting in the Lok Sabha. You can read more about it by clicking <a target="_blank" href="http://parliamentofindia.nic.in/ls/intro/p6.htm">here</a>.</p>
<p>1. <strong>The time and place to show their awareness quotient</strong> Let's not forget that <strong>many</strong> politicians are accomplished personalities. They usually have decades of experience ( which I hate to say, counts ) which does give them an edge in handling arguments. They might speak bull for most of the time, but the Question Hour is one time when they can <strong>question</strong> the other politicians over the inactions of their ministry.  This hour, shown LIVE on Doordarshan (and broadcasted later at night on All India Radio) is their chance to impress the masses , by asking important questions that demand important answers.</p>
<p>2. <strong>They ask pressing questions</strong> (Most) Indian politicians are not really the street smart kind, but yes, they do have a level of intelligence to manipulate situations to their advantage. As said before, the questions they put forth are pretty much of <strong>national importance</strong> - and they expose areas that are <strong>being ignored by the government, </strong>only to be given further assurances by the minister answering the question. Take cues from the answer - and swoop in  and solve the issue.</p>
<p>3.<strong> Authentic figures and quotes</strong> The questions asked , and the answers provided are usually filled with a lot of numbers - and as any good economist will tell you - the numbers give you the crux of the issue. Use a pen and paper (or any text editor) and note down anything that might alert your entrepreneurial antenna. These figures <strong>can</strong> be trusted, as they are being provided by the highest officials in the country in the Lok Sabha - this can almost be used as an authentic citation by anyone.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Gold Mine of Opportunities</strong> Even if the question doesn't remotely relate to your interests, it opens up a plethora of similar questions you can ask yourself about similar problems. Almost every single question brings with itself a gold mine of opportunities for you to dive in and explore, research , and more importantly ACT on it. Remember , BIG problems need not have BIG solutions. It can be as simple as reducing one olive per salad and saving up a bunch of money.</p>
<p>5. <strong>You will stand out</strong> Ask any marketing guru and he will repeat the age-old adage 'Be the Best to beat the Rest' - well I just made that up, but you catch my drift. Using ideas and statistics from the Question Hour will not only elevate you above everybody else in an intelligent conversation about the problem, but also act as impressive selling point to angel investors, VCs and your customers. Finally, you can showcase <strong>YOUR</strong> smart idea to solve the national crisis. All this wrapped up in a solid pitch is surely bound to impress.</p>
<p>So, what are you waiting for? Switch on DD/AIR and listen away - don't forget to take notes because I'm yet to find a source for the daily transcript of the Question Hour - something that would make a perfect gift for any opportunist entrepreneur. There must be an archive of these transcripts somewhere and I wonder if RTI can be used for such a purpose.</p>
