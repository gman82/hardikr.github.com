<h2>Don't Be Brave</h2>


<p><em>NB: It gives me great sadness to write this. Some of you may be shocked and offended at the start, but please, read through the whole post, before making up your minds prematurely. I would like to state that I have great respect for all the brave people in the world, and I don't write this to offend you, but I just write it to put my own thoughts in black and white. I don't intend to mock anyone being described as brave.<br /></em></p>
<p>My heart goes out to all the brave people out there, some of them getting recent coverage on Indian television because of the Godfrey Phillips Bravery Awards campaign. They say, "Be Brave. You'll get respect for free."</p>
<p>On an Indian English news channel , I saw a two minute re-enactment of how a man was shot dead (RIP) (and got his friend injured) while trying to stop an armed thief from stealing his briefcase. I must say, that's quite brave, and I respect the man. I was shell-shocked to see this act of bravery.</p>
<p>Wait, let's track back, shall we? The deceased man had a family, so he definitely had something to live for. Now, a thief armed with a handgun tried to steal a briefcase from him. Let's assume that he had *all* his life savings in that briefcase, every single penny. Put in some gold and diamonds in it, and also some blank cheques, credit cards and anything that has monetary worth. Is this briefcase worth dying for ?</p>
<p>After his friend got shot and injured, he still chose to fight back, and died in the process of trying to save a briefcase. I would surely call this bravery. Definitely. My heart goes out to his family and I pray they have the courage to deal with this loss of a phenomenal and brave human being.</p>
<p>But, when you're getting mugged by someone with a handgun, and your friend gets shot (proving the handgun is in fact real with real bullets) , the&nbsp;<strong>BRAVEST&nbsp;</strong>thing to do would be to surrender whatever the hell the thief is looking for. Whatever he is looking for is not worth risking your life, it's not worth losing your life,&nbsp; and it's definitely not worth making your family grieve over your dead body.</p>
<p>Honestly, I see bravery only worth it if you come out alive - which is not in your hands. Another of these advertisements for Godfrey Phillips Bravery Awards illustrate how a man took on an entire group of people who were eve-teasing a girl in a train. That's really admirable, and I would probably do the same. But what was stopping those group of people from throwing the brave man off the train? Sounds ridiculous, but mind you it's not impossible. I'm just illustrating as to why being brave in some situations is not a good idea. Would you say it's worth dying to protect the girl's dignity ? I don't know. It's a question similar to these questions psychologists use to mess around with us ( eg : You have the option to save either your parent/sibling/child/spouse or&nbsp;<strong>ten&nbsp;</strong>unknown people. Who would you save? ) . Such questions really irk me, as I cannot answer them, but they definitely set me thinking.</p>
<p>Sure, I'm not one of those 'army' types who are ready to sacrifice themselves for other people of their nation ( Army/Navy/Air Force guys are just awesome, I really wish I had the courage to be like them) but this bravery being promoted on television is quite something else. The problem I have is, citing these examples , they say "Be Brave", indirectly saying that the next time you're being mugged, get killed.</p>
<p>Sorry! I refuse to believe in that sort of "bravery". If that's what people in India believes bravery is, then I say Don't be "Brave". But be Brave. What's the difference you ask ? Being "Brave" (as illustrated by the couple of examples above) is fine, to an extent. But when you've got a gun at your face, you don't be Brave. Hell, even James Bond doesn't fool around when he has a gun pointed at him. I digress, but you catch my drift right?</p>
<p>Now, being brave, the actual brave, is just awesome. Help the old lady cross the road. Thumbs up. How many people crawl out of their shells to do that ? Resist the temptation to pay beggar kids and sponsor a child's education for a year ? Awesome ! And when you're getting mugged ? Resist, to an extent. But when you've got a gun pointed at you (and you don't happen to have one pointed back), chill out ! Do what the bugger says, and get home alive, hug your family and start from scratch if you just lost all your money.</p>
<p>Rudyard Kipling explains my point really well in his poem&nbsp;<em><a target="_blank" href="http://www.kipling.org.uk/poems_if.htm">If</a></em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><span>Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,<br />And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:<br /></span><span>If you can make one heap of all your winnings<br />And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,<br />And lose, and start again at your beginnings<br />And never breathe a word about your loss;<br />If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew<br />To serve your turn long after they are gone,<br />And so hold on when there is nothing in you<br />Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'</span></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you pick up the hints all along, it can be summed up as <strong>even if you've lost everything in the world, you will be brave if you start all over</strong>. The end is the key, the&nbsp;<strong>Will to Hold on</strong>. It's a human tendency to hold on to your own life. It's like that famous joke, which turns out to be anything but.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Everybody wants to go to heaven, but nobody wants to die.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's really admirable to sacrifice your life for somebody else, but it's quite something else do die trying to protect a 'thing'.&nbsp;</p>
