<h2>A Better India</h2>


<p><pre>This essay is a work in progress. More stuff to be added soon.</pre></p>
<p>If you're Indian, the recent flurry of scandals must be quite disturbing/amusing to you, depending on how you view the Indian political system. To me, it was quite disappointing.</p>
<p>Knowing that India is run by these douchebags is just SAD. Sure, the cynic would say, if you want to change the system, be the change. Let's see, I'm 22 now. By the time I'll be in a position of power, I would be ~60-70, and would've wasted my life bringing these idiots their morning tea. What the cynics don't see is, at 65, I would've already become the <em>last</em> generation, ready to rule over the <em>next</em> generation. That's what's wrong. Totally wrong. The people of today need to rule over the people of today. What if a bunch of people started going <a target="_blank" href="http://www.buzzle.com/articles/medieval-tortures-medieval-punishments-and-torture-devices.html">medieval</a> on these politicians? They surely wouldn't be a happy bunch.</p>
<p>The average Indian is in their mid twenties, and the average age of an Indian politician (in a position of power - member of Lok Sabha/Rajya Sabha/Ministry) would be at least in the late fifties to the early sixties. This disparity is just mind-boggling. It almost seems unfair.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's take an example, the Information Technology (Amendment) Act, 2008. According to Wikipedia,</p>
<blockquote>Section 69 empowers the Central Government/State Government/ its authorized agency to intercept, monitor or decrypt any information generated, transmitted, received or stored in any computer resource if it is necessary or expedient so to do in the interest of the sovereignty or integrity of India, defence of India, security of the State, friendly relations with foreign States or public order or for preventing incitement to the commission of any cognizable offence or for investigation of any offence. They can also secure assistance from computer personnel in decrypting data (see&nbsp;<a title="Mandatory decryption" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_decryption">mandatory decryption</a>), under penalty of imprisonment.</blockquote>
<p>In other words, you can be jailed for not disclosing your private data to the government, if need be. So, it's your liberty that's on sale. The government can just take it away from you, whenever they want.</p>
<p>This is a frivolous clause. I can understand terrorism, and terrorists and those LeT people we're so afraid of. But, just imagine the repercussions of the misuse of the above. Who are these people who've passed the law? Do they know <strong>anything</strong>&nbsp;about computers, cryptography or information security? If an all-star techie guy (no, not you, Mr. Fadia) &nbsp;were to be a part of this committee who drafted this law, there would've been <strong>NO </strong>way this would've passed. This is an outright violation of the philosophy of free (both the meanings).</p>
<p>It all comes down to the people, who've come up with these ridiculous laws. We need the right people. As Andy Rutledge noted on Twitter,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We need men who are more honorable and more moral, not laws that are more restrictive upon liberty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Get the right people to run the country, and the country would be awesome itself! A country is hardly different from an organization. If an organization lacks the right leaders with the right vision, it's going to the dumpster (and so is India). Sure, the cynic would say, with a smug smile on his face, '<em>You're the people who voted them into power'.</em>&nbsp;There lies another problem. The blatant selling of votes, even extortion to force people into voting for particular candidates makes this country's democracy a <strong>farce. </strong>Am I supposed to vote for the party which has the least number of criminals in their ranks? Or for the one that has the least corrupt people? On what metric do I judge these people? I'd rather note vote. (Yes, even if you drink Tata Tea and get inspired by their commercials.)</p>
<p>So, how would I go about changing India ? One thing that's been missing is <strong>disruption</strong>. We need something to give a knockout punch to the existing system. We need a radical thinker to change this madness of a country we call the biggest democracy in the world. We need people to revolt. We need change. (yeah yeah Obama jokes whatever. Grow up.)</p>
<p>I start off with national-level suggestions, and gradually trickle down to suggestions you can personally use in your everyday life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. <strong>Have a separate government for the rural and urban areas.</strong></p>
<p>This may sound radical at first, but it's quite logical (if you happen to have an IQ of over 10). Clearly, the needs of rural and urban India are different. The rural areas need a makeover, the governments are not doing enough to protect and work for the their progress. It's a miserable situation for the farmers of India. On the other hand, the urban (middle-class) Indian is not happy either. With mindless policies, laws and acts (like the one I illustrated above), the urban Indian is pissed. It may be naive to say this, but George Carlin's philosophy holds completely true.</p>
<blockquote>The rich have all the money, and pay none of the taxes. The middle class have none of the money , and pay all of the taxes. The poor, they're just there to scare the shit out of the middle class.</blockquote>
<p>These three classes of people require <strong>different </strong>spans of attention. The rich, are like these spoiled&nbsp;kids, always ready to dodge this tax, run over poor people with their huge cars, and buy their way out of trouble. We&nbsp;need people to be looking out for these spoiled kids, and make sure they stay on track. For the middle class, we need people who can think like them. Let's face it, no matter how hard the rich try, they just can't figure out <strong>how to think like&nbsp;the middle class</strong>. And the poor, well, they just need some money. No disrespect to them, but money is all they need, to get a shelter over their heads, food in their mouths, and the ability to raise healthy children (not too many though).</p>
<p>2. <strong>Get rid of ridiculous laws</strong></p>
<p>Examples: One, I've already mentioned above. Two, let's take a generally taboo topic, alcohol. The legal age to consume alcohol in India ranges from 18-25! Get this right! Twenty-five. I wonder what sort of science went into this selection. Or probably, it was a negotiation deal.<br /><em>5.. 50.. 15.. 35.. 20.. 27.. 25..<br /></em>Really, this must've been the reasoning. Also, how many drunk 18-year olds have you seen beat women to death, compared to 30-50 year olds? Any answer?</p>
<p>Also, it's considered a dry-day on certain days.<br />- <strong>Gandhi Jayanti</strong> - Why ? Beats me. He advocated freedom. If on his birthday, we don't have the freedom to do something&nbsp;we want to do, how's this respecting him? It's actually disrespecting the Mahatma.<br />- <strong>Voting Days </strong>- This one's even more interesting. Ever heard of the expression, <em>sach baahar aa jaata hai</em>&nbsp;(the truth comes out) , when you consume alcohol ? Well, maybe they don't want people to get drunk and realize that they're being disillusioned to vote for someone who doesn't give a shit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another law: Gambling is restricted. Why? Am I expected to believe that the Indian government does not trust Indians with their own money? Why should the government get to decide how someone spends their own money, after already taking a big chunk off it as tax? Why is gambling legal in Goa? Is it for the enjoyment of foreigners? Why's it legal in Sikkim? Why is horse-racing the only sport in which gambling is legal - considering that it can be manipulated as easily as any other sport? Why is <em><a target="_blank" href="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bingo_(Commonwealth)">Housie</a></em>&nbsp;legal ? Isn't it a form of gambling after all? What about the stock market? Is that not gambling your money? It just doesn't make sense.</p>
<p>This is just the beginning, and I'm no lawyer. Speak to one, and you'll find hundreds, if not thousands of ridiculous laws, either outdated or just plain stupid.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Keep a Test</strong></p>
<p>Yes, this one's the most important for selecting our 'leaders'. Everyone who wants to stand for a State/National election, <strong>must exhibit a mental/physical/emotional capability to run the country, by means of a written, oral and practical test of his/her understanding of the Indian Constitution, Indian law,Indian and world economics, and general knowledge. Further, his morality rating should be greater than 90 on a scale of 0-100, and should not have been convicted in ANY criminal case. Additionally, after every six-months of service, they have to undergo a review by an independent committee of retired Army Generals (IMO they're less prone to bribes, and have a history of dedicated service to the country) &nbsp;and around 10 randomly selected citizens of the country (selected by a computer program).</strong></p>
<p>After all, this is what the Courts and Government of India advocate with our educational system. If the children and the youth of India have to prove their worth to be in the (mind you) <strong>crappiest</strong> schools and colleges of the world, why don't the people who run the country need to be&nbsp;continually evaluated?&nbsp;In fact, these are the people who <strong>need</strong>&nbsp;tests. The current educational system is a farce as well, and that brings me to my next point.</p>
<p>4. <a name="education" id="education"><strong>Overturn the educational system</strong></a></p>
<p>The current educational system is a joke. We all know it. Yet, the kids go through these mindless cramming sessions. There is a reason why Indian universities are no good, it's because the Indian schools are no good. It's a domino effect. Let's take the case of the IT revolution.</p>
<p>I can discount the fact that the majority of the computer revolution happened in the West, because in the fifties/sixties, we were just coming out of being ruled by the British, and had no time for building computers. Our first priority was to stabilize the country.</p>
<p>But, the IT revolution and the internet revolution, is something that cannot be discounted, and the Indian educational system has to take the blame. Think about it, why did Microsoft, Yahoo, Apple, Google, Facebook, and primarily, the <strong>Silicon Valley</strong>&nbsp;come out of the USA? Why hasn't India managed to produce <strong>one </strong>major company that has turned the IT world upside down, like the above companies have ? That's because the Americans were encouraging their kids to hack their Ataris, Nintendos, PCs and Macs, and on the other hand, we were <strong>forbidding</strong>&nbsp;the children to use PCs, mobiles, reduce their time of playing computer games, banning their use in schools (we still are) and discouraging them to use technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To sum up, the Indian educational system sucks, and even though we've managed to produce a few smart people who can actually solve a problem without mugging up a solution, it doesn't count. It's worse than finding a needle in a haystack.</p>
<p>We need to <strong>adopt, and reform</strong>. We need to adopt the <strong>proven</strong>&nbsp;track record of the best schools and universities outside India, and reform our thoughts about the Indian educational system, and re-think if it's any good or not.</p>
<p>5. <strong>Use Technology</strong></p>
<p>When you look at India, you get this image that Indians are almost reluctant to use technology. Let's see, if we would've adopted the idea of the Western broom, with a tall handle so you can stand upright and sweep, <strong>maybe, </strong>just <strong>maybe, </strong>75% of Indian women would not have had back problems. But no, we're <em>uptight</em>, and we stuck with our Indian brooms, and courtesy to that you can see most Indian women holding their backs.</p>
<p>Indians have always been resistant to change. We're filled with the <em>chalta hai</em>&nbsp;(it's fine, let it be) attitude and apply it to almost all facets in our life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It took so, so, so longggggggggggggggggg to get DSL connections to the public in India. Even now, a 2Mbps connection (which hardly yields 1Mbps in practise) is considered a premium, and the telecom operators are having a field day by over-charging customers, providing low-quality service and frustrating the urban Indian public. They have so-called <strong>Fair-Usage Policies</strong>&nbsp;on all connections (including ones they call <em>'Unlimited'</em>) which limit the download sizes to as low as 250 MB.&nbsp;(Note to self: Existing telecom providers to be done away with.)</p>
<p>There's so <strong>much</strong>&nbsp;of technology available, for little or no cost, to be used in almost every walk of life. Yet, we prefer our old ways. All I'm saying is , get your act together and use what's available! A simple example: home-security systems are almost rare in houses of middle-class people, even those who know they're susceptible to get robbed. Yet, <em>chalta hai.</em></p>
<p>6. <strong>Open source the resource-allocation.</strong></p>
<p>India needs some good accountants, coupled with awesome administrators, to keep track of <strong>resource allocation. </strong>Once resource allocation can be tracked, monitored and open-sourced, i.e., available for the public to see <strong>easily</strong>&nbsp;without having to file an RTI application and pay off thousands in bribes, corruption will automatically reduce.</p>
<p>What was the problem in the 2G spectrum case? Resource allocation! If there were a thousand people actively monitoring&nbsp;this process, it would've been very <strong>very </strong>difficult to get away with corruption.</p>
<p>If transparency is not ensured, I won't be surprised if an Indian edition of Wikileaks crops up. Ah, the sweet smell of revolution.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;<strong><strike>Reduce</strike>&nbsp;Remove Censorship. Increase Free Speech</strong></p>
<p>'The Social Network' was one movie I was so excited about. And the Censor Board ruined it. At the start and the end of the movie, two women critically analyze Mark Zuckerberg, and these were the pivotal two dialogues in the movie. And, those dialogues were censored. Why? Here's the interesting part: This is what the Censor Board CEO,&nbsp;<strong>Pankaja Thakur&nbsp;</strong>(firstly, I didn't know they had a CEO) had to say, when approached by a journalist on the why she did the horrendous act of snipping the most important dialogs in the movie.</p>
<blockquote>"Now that you mention it,&rdquo; she replies, &ldquo;that was a mistake. I gave the film a certificate so that school children could see it because of the Facebook craze these days. I thought it would be interesting for them, including my 11-year-old daughter. I didn&rsquo;t realise that crucial dialogues in the &nbsp;beginning and the end (when two different women analyse Zuckerberg, thus tying the film together) would get mutilated. Given a chance, I wouldn&rsquo;t do it again."</blockquote>
<p>Let's get this straight. First, she obviously did not understand the movie. So why is she censoring English movies in the first place? Then, she ruined one of the most anticipated movies of the year for the whole country because&nbsp;<strong>she wanted her daughter to see it?&nbsp;</strong>Are you frikkin kidding me?</p>
<p>I demand, that if she has any self-respect or character, she write a personal apology letter to every Indian who saw this movie for ruining a perfect movie, reimburse the money we paid to watch it, and hold uncensored re-screenings for free.</p>
<p>Moral of the story: Censorship of any form is bad. We&nbsp;<strong>must</strong>&nbsp;advocate freedom of expression.&nbsp;People are grown-up enough to decide what they want to see. The argument often provided in favor of censorship is,&nbsp;<em>oh the kids.</em>&nbsp;Fine, provide a certificate, and depend on the parents for making their choice. IMHO most kids are mature enough to withstand a 'bad word' or two. They're not gonna die, or grow deaf, or blind or grow a fresh pair of horns. Actually, on the contrary, they seem to enjoy the little&nbsp;<em>thrill</em>&nbsp;they get out of it. And&nbsp;<strong>this&nbsp;</strong>is what the 'elders' seem to have a problem with.</p>
<p>8. <strong>Amend the Courts</strong></p>
<p>The honorary courts of India have often made really good decisions, but often some really, really horrible ones as well. The thing about these people, they sit on their high chairs, they decide if someone else gets to live, or die, or how harsh the sentence should be.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's take a sample ruling in question. In 1983, the Supreme Court ruled that hanging did not involve torture, barbarity, humiliation or degradation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone in their right minds ever hold such an opinion? If they were so sure, why didn't the judges demonstrate the same by hanging themselves? If hanging doesn't involve&nbsp;torture, barbarity, humiliation or degradation, <strong>then what does?</strong></p>
<p>India needs to try bringing back the jury system, which is a <strong>much</strong>&nbsp;fairer way of deciding criminal cases, especially when someone's life is on the line. Also, a jury of twelve is much less prone to influence of bribes and other temptations rather than a single judge, because all you need is a single honest person in the twelve. It's not sure shot, but at least it improves the chances of providing a fair verdict.</p>
<p>The jury system in India, according to Wikipedia, was abolished in 1960, on the basis of a single case, where the judges felt the jury was misled by the presiding judge. On the basis of&nbsp;<strong>one </strong>case, they changed the <strong>whole system!</strong>. To me it sounds like India realized they were giving too much power to the people. But that was half a century ago. People today are much smarter, and it wouldn't harm to try it out.</p>
<p>9. <strong>Culture of accountability.</strong></p>
<p>I think one of the most frustrating things about being around Indians is - if something goes wrong, nobody wants to take the blame. Nobody will be accountable. Everyone will start pointing their index fingers at one another, expecting to brush off the blame from their own heads. Even if the wrong person is being punished, why care when you're safe and sound.</p>
<p>One of the more laudatory traits I've seen in Westerners is that they're not afraid to take the blame. They're not afraid of being accountable. Their attitude is more like , '<em>Yeah, I screwed up. So what?'</em>&nbsp;. This, again, goes back to the educational system.</p>
<p>We need to teach kids to think in this way. Its <strong>OKAY </strong>to be wrong, its <strong>PERFECTLY FINE</strong>&nbsp;to mess up, and its <strong>EXPECTED </strong>that you will, at some point or the other. Children should be handsomely rewarded when they own up to their mistakes. If you create such a culture at home/school, there's no doubt they'll grow up to be fantastic human beings. Instead, we will beat them, punish them and make them feel miserable just because our day at the crappy office didn't go well. And when they're grown up, and throw us out of their homes when we're old, we'll play the <em>old-person</em>&nbsp;card.</p>
<p>10. <strong>Stop stuffing religion down people's throats</strong></p>
<p>DISCLAIMER: This is not an anti-religion rant. Read the whole thing first, and then think about picking up your torches and spears.<br /><br />If the world has learned one thing from the pioneers of science in the past, it's that religion is not for everyone. You can't expect a scientist to believe there's a God in the sky, when he's controlling a probe that has reached the edge of the solar system. It just doesn't make sense to him/her. Their god is their work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a sensitive topic (I don't know why, but society dictates that it is), and hence I'll be succinct. Stop being shocked if your children don't believe in God. It's NOT a crime. After all, they're not extensions of you, but they're individuals of their own right. Don't stuff religious stories (which are not-bad, by the way) and beliefs down their throats if it's not meant to be.</p>
<p>Things are especially worse in India, where anti-religious topics are taboo in homes. Families cannot imagine oh-what-would-happen if they don't go to temple on a particular day, or they don't hold a particular <em>puja. </em>If families don't allow free-thinking and <em>questioning</em>, they're going to irrevocably damage their children who will function as mindless religious robots, just like they did. A person can only intellectually grow if he/she takes nothing for granted, and asks questions.</p>
<p>Also, as far as history is concerned, a majority of the ancient philosophers, and modern pioneers of science have been&nbsp;atheists. Let's just say if religion had it's way, the earth would've been flat, and the centre of the solar system. Not to mention, we wouldn't have been here today.</p>
<p>Religion and science have never quite gotten along with each other. There's a reason. Religion was always insecure about the <strong>faith</strong>&nbsp;being taken away by science. If we as Indians <strong>actually</strong>&nbsp;(and I'm saying actually, from the bottom of our hearts) knew there was no God, would we spend so much time on pleasing him through this <em>puja</em> and that <em>puja</em>? Do I hear a <em>yes? </em>I thought so. And there lies the problem.&nbsp;Religion has convinced (read <em>brainwashed</em>) people beyond reason.</p>
<p>But today, it's different. There are respected scientists, economists and thinkers who are pioneers in their fields, but also religious. That's an encouraging sign, and I hope religion does not come in the way of science and progress any more. Or else? Why ask me, when there's God?</p>
<p>11. <strong>Encourage other occupations</strong></p>
<p>Ask any twelfth grade kid what they wanna become. Wait wait, let me guess.. Engineer? Doctor? These two answers will cover 75-90% of the population.</p>
<p>Why? It's because they've been told so! They've been told that these are secure careers, else they wouldn't have a comfortable life, and would end-up marrying in a 'high-class' family. EOL (End of Life).</p>
<p>Kids have to be told. Engineering and medicine is not the end of life. What about a life-guard at a beach ? A wine connoisseur ? &nbsp;A best-selling author ? An <strong>entrepreneur!&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Now, this is my opinion, but entrepreneurs are the most kick-ass people around! They're far cooler than these corporate zombies you see floating around in their suits and ties. Entrepreneurs come to work in their slippers and beach shorts, and more importantly, they love what they do. If you love what you do, it won't feel like work! To quote Bachman-Turner Overdrive, from their lovely song <em>Taking Care of Business.</em></p>
<blockquote>You get up every morning<br />From your 'larm clock's warning<br />Take the 8:15 into the city<br />There's a whistle up above<br />And people pushin', people shovin'<br />And the girls who try to look pretty<br />And if your train's on time<br />You can get to work by nine<br />And start your slaving job to get your pay<br />If you ever get annoyed<br />Look at me I'm self-employed<br />I love to work at nothing all day..<br />..<br />People see you having fun<br />Just a-lying in the sun<br />Tell them that you like it this way<br />It's the work that we avoid<br />And we're all self-employed<br />We love to work at nothing all day<br />And we be<br /><br />Taking care of business (every day)<br />Taking care of business (every way)<br />We be been taking care of business (it's all mine)<br />Taking care of business and working overtime</blockquote>
<p>So, why wouldn't anyone want such a life? That's because they don't know! Ignorance is the major reason to people picking engineering and medicine. It's because they don't know that something else exists! Sure, formal education is necessary, but not from India. Reason? <a href="#education">I've already explained!</a></p>
<p>12. <strong>Stop being over-obsessive and&nbsp;</strong><strong>nosy</strong></p>
<p>Indians are notorious for being nosy. It's almost impossible for Indian parents to exist, even for a minute, without knowledge of the whereabouts of their children. Nope, it's not because they care too much, it's just that they're afraid to lose that obsessive controlling death-grip that they hold their children in.</p>
<p>Another thing I've noticed is how Indian parents don't allow children to lock their rooms, lest they may do something without their knowledge. Parents also don't knock before entering, go through their children's stuff without their permission and don't value privacy. Indian parents are some of the worst control-freaks around. Let Him Go ! Even if he has long hair/ big beard/ baggy pants! That's what kids do! Let them be kids! If parents don't let kids be kids, they start taking tension and do suicide shit. So just let them do what they want. Don't ruin it for them.</p>
<p>When I was in school, one particularly nosy teacher remarked. '<em>You boys! Spending too much time in the bathroom setting your hair and adjusting your attire! Are you coming to a school or what?'</em>&nbsp;Everyone in the class laughed. And I thought to myself, 'Wait a minute! How did <strong>she</strong> know what was going on in the boys' bathroom unless, she peeked through that little rectangular cut-out glass window in the door of the bathroom!' . And there, standing at over six-feet tall, our teacher, was proof enough that she was a nosy control-freak.</p>
<p>This nosy behavior transmits from generation to generation, and it's time we put an end to it. Let children play around, or do whatever they want. It's their thing. If you've put <em>any</em> efforts into bringing them up the right way, then you don't need to worry even a bit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Else you can go back to being a control freak and know that you never gave a damn about your children's childhood.</p>
<p>It's not just kids. Corporate bosses act like crime warlords when they look over their employees, and they want to keep track of every minute that they've spent in the office, or sometimes even outside office. And why do bosses do this? It's because their parents did it to them when they were kids. So they think it's OKAY to do it. So, stop being a control freak, for the sake of your kids, and their employees in the future.</p>
