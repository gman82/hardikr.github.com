	<h2><a href="http://blog.hardikr.com/startups/a-time-for-new-mistakes">A Time for New Mistakes</a></h2>
	<div class="post-meta">
		<div class="meta-date">March 23, 2011
	</div>
	<p>Most startup people are ex-disgruntled folks, having grown beards of experience in their jobs which they held for years and they were so sick of, attempting to quit their jobs day-in and day-out like it was a terrible addiction, and finally picking up the courage to do so. Alas, all those hours of slogging away at work, coding into the night for your company's new projects, teaming up with brilliant and quirky programmers, getting admonished for making mistakes in the production release of the code-base; all these things come to an end. Time and experience has made them the wiser.</p>

<p>They've found a new life. They've rediscovered what's it like to be a workaholic, but only this time they enjoy doing it. They've discovered a new passion ( it's usually photography ) , and they've started to finally love what they do for a living.  They're ready to sacrifice anything and everything for their startup to succeed. Every minute spent not doing anything else counts to making the startup a success. Some founders even make corn-flakes to make their ends meet.</p>

<p>Such traits amongst startup folk are quite common. The process of quitting your job and starting a startup is often called "<em>taking the plunge"</em>, giving an impression of a thrill-ride, an exciting jump into periods of uncertainty and freedom from the shackles of the corporate world. All quite true, since when you're doing a startup, you literally feel all these feelings I've just described. The free-fall into a world of entrepreneurship can be scary and intimidating, but which <em>plunge</em> isn't ?</p>

<p>So, why would someone go in the opposite direction? Why would someone attempt a startup after graduation, know that it's the right thing to do, and still turn to a job ? The startup failed ? Sure ! But that provides more motivation to me than anything else!  The result of a month-long self-introspection, all <em>while</em> coding the next phase of my startup, was that I was never destined to work in a corporate environment. That's just not me. I'll not end up doing that.</p>

<p>But, there's a big difference in the '<em>end up doing a job'</em> for the rest of my life, and doing a job to gain relevant experience. And I did feel the hit, I did feel something missing, in-spite of my <a href="http://lpad.in">mentor</a> doing everything he could to keep me on track. Towards the end of the fifth month, a combination of restlessness, lack of clarity, lack of self-esteem (couldn't go for Masters, and no current income), homesickness (probably induced by staying away from home for the last four years) and a bunch of other really complicated stuff gave way to me going home for the aforementioned month-long much-needed break.</p>

<p>I see this as just a break from my startup. My instinct told me I needed a break, and I took it. It may last months, or even years. But I'll be back. As much as I'm enjoying my position as web developer with my new employer, where I get to work on really exciting new technologies and stuff, I know that it's not my cup of tea for too long. I can never, ever do a job for my whole life! ( Please don't fire me yet :P ) .</p>

<p>But for now, it's time to make a bunch of new mistakes. That's what's life's all about (three apostrophe s' consecutively) ! I knew I could not learn from others' mistakes so passively. I had to make some of them on my own. But the beautiful and the best part is the grand scheme of things. Remember what Steve Jobs said, 'You can never connect the dots looking forward. You can only connect them looking backward.'</p>

<p>Trusting your instincts is something that'll probably never let you down. I'm pretty sure the dots will connect. I just can't see it right now! In the grand scheme of things, things will work out! I may sound like a lunatic trying to continuously reassure myself, but you could look back on your own life, and you'll see how even really bad things eventually led to something nice happening. It's statistically inevitable. After bad stuff happens, it's time for the good stuff, and hence the dots end up connecting. Sure, you may call it <em>karma</em>, religion or Justin Beiber if you're into that sort of a thing. But I'm sure a good mathematician could prove this <em>connecting of dots </em>Steve Jobs speaks about.</p>

	<h2><a href="http://blog.hardikr.com/tech/a-week-with-blackberry">A Week with BlackBerry</a></h2>
	<div class="post-meta">
		<div class="meta-date">March 15, 2011
	</div>
	<p>I've now spent over a week with the Blackberry Curve 9300, which is the first in the Curve series to have 3G and GPS.. I guess at around 300$, that was a decent buy.</p>
<p>This is my first smartphone (I know!!), but I am in a position to compare BlackBerry with iOS, since I've owned an iPod touch for a good while now, and have extensively used the App Store and all the great apps that come with it. I'll be talking about BlackBerry iOS 5.0 and Apple iOS 4.2.1</p>
<p><strong>First, the obvious and the ugly</strong>. The BB App Store sucks. I'm thankful for my iPod touch without which apps like Instapaper, Angry Birds, TinyWings and $_your_favorite_app would only be a distant dream.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The prominent apps in the BB App Store are the social media giants: Facebook, Twitter, FourSquare and those apps are god-awful. The Facebook app is especially made to make sharing as difficult as possible. The Twitter app looks like it's doing a favor to me in terms of the UI/UX, and geotagging seems to be a feature missing (or very difficult to find, at best). The FourSquare just about passes the mark, but it often fails to connect to it's mother ship, even when the BB data services are working fine.<br /><br />Another thing worth mentioning here would be that BB allows access to the App Store, and usage of these mainstream apps only over it's data service, and they DO NOT work over a wireless connection. It's as blatant a way of saying, "Either pay for our data connection every month, or get lost". They expect me, as a smartphone buyer, not to access the basic features of a smartphone, aka social media (which they actually use to sell this product) over Wi-Fi hotspots, which are fast becoming the major way of accessing the Internet at home and at work. This decision has really set a rebellious anti-BlackBerry sentiment inside me.</p>
<p><strong>Moving on to the slightly better features. </strong>My primary motive to buy the BB was to stay in touch better with my parents - who stay apart - and of course with other friends. When my parents get a BB, the BlackBerry Messenger (BBM) provides them a seamless and cheap way of keeping in touch with me. I really love the concept of a mobile P2P network, and BBM becomes a really dirt cheap way of keeping in touch with the many circles of friends I have. I hate spending time on Facebook, and I see BBM becoming one of the major modes of communication with my friends who have a BB. What about those who don't have a BB? Good old e-mail and SMS!</p>
<p><strong>The best part about the BlackBerry experience:&nbsp;</strong>The way the BB handles e-mail is quite unparalleled. With it's push technology, superior attachment handling features, and seamless integration with major e-mail services, this is really the selling point of the BlackBerry when it comes to email power users. Logging on to GMail and replying to e-mails is another thing I hate doing, and it really simplifies this a lot for me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The BB messages application integrates SMS, Email, Facebook and Twitter in an uncluttered fashion, and it's good to have all my notifications in one place. This is BlackBerry's forte, where it's so smooth and makes my life much easier. The iOS team can learn a bunch from the BB guys. I've used the native iOS mail application, and it leaves much to be desired.</p>
<p><strong>On Multitasking: </strong>This is the area where the BB beats the iOS hands-down. I'm talking zero-lag multi-tasking of <em>n</em>&nbsp;number of apps compared to the sluggish multitasking of iOS 4. The BB has not showed a hint of slowing down with over 15-20 apps running simultaneously, and switching amongst them is a breeze. The iOS could do <em>much, much</em> better here (and it sure is poised to, with the processors becoming faster and even more powerful.)</p>
<p>Overall, you cannot really compare iOS to BlackBerry as the audience is completely different. BlackBerry caters to two major classes of people - First, the age group of 13-21. Second, the working class who make their living on answering e-mails. Whereas the iOS has an almost zero entry barrier and I've seen everyone from the kid, the mom and the business guy effectively utilize an iPhone. However, it costs a fortune in India, and I don't see it capturing the Indian market like it has in the West, unless they reduce the damn prices.</p>

	<h2><a href="http://blog.hardikr.com/india/egypt-india">Egypt, India</a></h2>
	<div class="post-meta">
		<div class="meta-date">March 01, 2011
	</div>
	<p>Keeping in tune with my last post about <a href='http://blog.hardikr.com/startups/call-me'>verbs</a>, <em>pulling off an ‘Egypt’</em> seems like a acceptable phrase that India can aspire to. Let’s take a look at some of the causes of the Egyptian Revolution of 2011. Let’s stack up Egypt’s problems alongside India’s (with utmost respect towards Egypt, I know it was much worse off than India is now, but just for the sake or argument). According to Wikipedia,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>…over a million people were protesting to demand the overthrow of the Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, an end to corruption and police repression, and democratic reforms of the political system.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Corruption: ✓<br />Police Repression: ✓<br />Democratic Reforms Required: ✓</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Grievances of Egyptian protesters have focused on legal and political issues including police brutality, state of emergency laws, lack of free elections and freedom of speech, and uncontrollable corruption, as well as economic issues including high unemployment, food price inflation, and low minimum wages.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Legal and political issues: ✓<br />Police Brutality: ✓<br />State of Emergency Laws: x<br />Lack of Free Elections: ✓ (Most of the members of parliament just inherit the posts from the previous generations of their family. I would hardly call that free elections.)<br />Lack of Freedom of Speech: ✓<br />Uncontrollable Corruption: ✓<br />High Unemployment: - (Admittedly, India did decently well to control the effect of the recession.)<br />Food Price Inflation: ✓<br />Low Minimum Wages: ✓</p>

<p>Well, India has a lot of things going for it when the leaders claim that the inflation rate is a sign of economic growth. I don’t buy it, however. And Economics Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen doesn’t either, who was Johnny-on-the-spot <a href='http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hPEP4v8X3uqX4vQ-KSlAVXxbqY0A?docId=CNG.26f85a77fe573d0130a10eb475c1a65e.c41'>recently</a>,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sen argued that New Delhi was far behind in the growth race, but more importantly it lagged in other criteria that showed real living standards were far inferior in India.</p>

<p>Life expectancy at birth in China was 73.5 years compared with 64.4 years in India; Infant mortality rate is 50 per thousand in India and just 17 in China, and the under-five mortality rate is 66 for Indians and 19 for the Chinese.</p>

<p>China’s adult literacy rate is 94 percent, compared with India’s 65 percent, and mean years of schooling in India is 4.4 years, compared with 7.5 years in China, he said.</p>

<p>“Almost half of our children are undernourished compared with a very tiny proportion in China,” Sen added.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, it’s not just me who agrees that this obsession of thinking that India is actually growing is unhealthy, unfounded and unfair to the middle and lower class, who pay taxes and die respectively.</p>

<p>I’ve said it over and over again, when a country cannot stop it’s children from dying, that means something’s wrong. While we’re spending millions on our defense research to launch <a href='http://news.google.co.in/news/url?sa=t&amp;ct2=in/0_0_s_0_0_t&amp;ct3=MAA4AEgAUABgAWoCaW4&amp;usg=AFQjCNGwSh9GKChv4xi-cOLtqmY8CMYjfw&amp;cid=8797660069560&amp;ei=rohbTaCbK8G3cKXNzN0C&amp;rt=SEARCH&amp;vm=STANDARD&amp;url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/DRDO-develops-mosquito-repellent-cream/articleshow/7496555.cms'>mosquito repellent creams</a>, more than 2.35 million under the age of five <a href='http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/11/13/us-india-deaths-child-idUSTRE6AC01Y20101113'>die</a> every year (60% of them from easily avoidable causes.) Does <em>anybody else</em> see a problem here?</p>

<p>So let’s see, what options do we have to set things right? I’m actually at a loss of words when I think about the arduous process to get anything done from the government of India.</p>

<p>Let’s pull of an Egypt.</p>

	<h2><a href="http://blog.hardikr.com/startups/call-me">Call Me, or How Becoiming a Verb is a Sign of Success</a></h2>
	<div class="post-meta">
		<div class="meta-date">February 09, 2011
	</div>
	<p>If you’ve ever noticed, many of the successful technologies that have emerged over the past century, have become verbs of their own right, or become the de-facto ‘direct object’ of an <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verb#Valency'>intransitive verb</a>. First we have some of the golden oldies,</p>

<p><em>&#8220;Call me&#8221;<br />&#8220;Fax me&#8221;<br />&#8220;E-mail me&#8221; / &#8220;Check my e-mail&#8221;<br />&#8220;Watching TV&#8221;<br />&#8220;Digg it&#8221;</em></p>

<p>And today, some new players that have turned proper nouns into verbs.</p>

<p><em>&#8220;Chatting with ..&#8221;<br />&#8220;Google it&#8221;<br />&#8220;Facebook me&#8221; / &#8220;Surfing Facebook&#8221;<br />&#8220;Tweet me&#8221; / &#8220;TweetUp&#8221;<br />&#8220;Dropbox the file&#8221;<br />&#8220;Instapaper it&#8221;<br />&#8220;Reddit it&#8221;<br />&#8220;Radbox it&#8221;</em></p>

<p>Verbs have this strange force about them. There’s an inherent sense of authority/action about them that tends to catch on. A psycholinguist would definitely be in a better position to explain, if and why, verbs are words of power.</p>

<p>Obviously, some technologies/products are almost incapable of becoming a verb, say the iPhone, and it obviously doesn’t make it any less of a success story. But, this is just something interesting to keep in mind while marketing your product !</p>

<p><em>Disclaimer: I write this as a marketing layman. So, don’t blame me if you market your startup as a verb and it doesn’t work out ;)</em></p>

	<h2><a href="http://blog.hardikr.com/satire/jo-jeeta-banned">Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikander to be Banned</a></h2>
	<div class="post-meta">
		<div class="meta-date">January 25, 2011
	</div>
	<p>The 1992 cult movie <em><a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104561/' title='Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar'>Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar</a></em> is all set to be banned in India, following repeated protests of parents, teachers and child-rights groups and activists.</p>

<p>The decision came after parents all over the country threatened to burn down the only movie theater in the country that still shows the movie, a 50 seater cinema at Baltana, Punjab.</p>

<p>One enraged parent says,</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>This is not the way we teach our kids. The title of the movie itself demonstrates that only the winner can be championed. Look at me, I was an average student, and now have an average salary. Yet, I can afford to drive my <a href='http://www.scootygals.com/' title='TVS Scooty'>Scooty</a> to work. Is that not that winning ? If we don&#8217;t teach our kids that being average is acceptable, they will all try to do extravagant things like not taking up engineering or medicine. How will my children be winners if they don&#8217;t take up one of those two professions?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As contentious as this parent&#8217;s claim may be, it certainly hasn&#8217;t deterred the rest of the Indian parents to joining in with the protests, and echoing their concerns.</p>

<p>Sources claim that certain factions of the Indian public have called that all broadcasters in the world should ban this movie, lest any children of the NRI community (or those of the Hindi-speaking foreign community) get affected.</p>

<p>Reacting to this, Aayesha Jhulka, one of the stars in the movie (that seemingly launched her career) says,</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>I can understand why Indian parents want to ban this movie.<br />However, I am totally against it because it&#8217;s one of the few movies on my Wikipedia page that has an entry darn&#8217;it!</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Education Minister of India, who prefers to remain anonymous, has reinforced that the decision is left to Pankaja Thakur, the CEO of the Censor Board of India. When we approached Mrs. Thakur, she made the following comments,</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>I know that we (The Censor Board of India) are notorious for censoring some of the most obscure things around. You know, I actually censored the two most important lines in the movie, &#8216;The Social Network&#8217;, so I could avoid giving it an &#8216;Adult&#8217; certificate and my daughter could watch it.<br />(pauses and raises hand for a high-five, to which our reporter reluctantly obliges)<br />Anyway, coming back to</em>Jo Jeeta<em>, yeah, consider it banned.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Meanwhile, the Indian intellectual community on Twitter has strongly condemned this ban, saying that banning a movie is not the Censor Board&#8217;s job anyway. In reply, Mrs. Pankaja Thakur created a Twitter account, but couldn&#8217;t manage to find a way to tweet. She then snail-mailed the following comment:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>They call themselves intellectuals. Can&#8217;t they see I&#8217;m effectively censoring the whole movie?</em></p>
</blockquote>
