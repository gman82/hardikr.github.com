	<h2>A Time for New Mistakes</h2>

<p>Most startup people are ex-disgruntled folks, having grown beards of experience in their jobs which they held for years and they were so sick of, attempting to quit their jobs day-in and day-out like it was a terrible addiction, and finally picking up the courage to do so. Alas, all those hours of slogging away at work, coding into the night for your company's new projects, teaming up with brilliant and quirky programmers, getting admonished for making mistakes in the production release of the code-base; all these things come to an end. Time and experience has made them the wiser.</p>

<p>They've found a new life. They've rediscovered what's it like to be a workaholic, but only this time they enjoy doing it. They've discovered a new passion ( it's usually photography ) , and they've started to finally love what they do for a living.  They're ready to sacrifice anything and everything for their startup to succeed. Every minute spent not doing anything else counts to making the startup a success. Some founders even make corn-flakes to make their ends meet.</p>

<p>Such traits amongst startup folk are quite common. The process of quitting your job and starting a startup is often called "<em>taking the plunge"</em>, giving an impression of a thrill-ride, an exciting jump into periods of uncertainty and freedom from the shackles of the corporate world. All quite true, since when you're doing a startup, you literally feel all these feelings I've just described. The free-fall into a world of entrepreneurship can be scary and intimidating, but which <em>plunge</em> isn't ?</p>

<p>So, why would someone go in the opposite direction? Why would someone attempt a startup after graduation, know that it's the right thing to do, and still turn to a job ? The startup failed ? Sure ! But that provides more motivation to me than anything else!  The result of a month-long self-introspection, all <em>while</em> coding the next phase of my startup, was that I was never destined to work in a corporate environment. That's just not me. I'll not end up doing that.</p>

<p>But, there's a big difference in the '<em>end up doing a job'</em> for the rest of my life, and doing a job to gain relevant experience. And I did feel the hit, I did feel something missing, in-spite of my <a href="http://lpad.in">mentor</a> doing everything he could to keep me on track. Towards the end of the fifth month, a combination of restlessness, lack of clarity, lack of self-esteem (couldn't go for Masters, and no current income), homesickness (probably induced by staying away from home for the last four years) and a bunch of other really complicated stuff gave way to me going home for the aforementioned month-long much-needed break.</p>

<p>I see this as just a break from my startup. My instinct told me I needed a break, and I took it. It may last months, or even years. But I'll be back. As much as I'm enjoying my position as web developer with my new employer, where I get to work on really exciting new technologies and stuff, I know that it's not my cup of tea for too long. I can never, ever do a job for my whole life! ( Please don't fire me yet :P ) .</p>

<p>But for now, it's time to make a bunch of new mistakes. That's what's life's all about (three apostrophe s' consecutively) ! I knew I could not learn from others' mistakes so passively. I had to make some of them on my own. But the beautiful and the best part is the grand scheme of things. Remember what Steve Jobs said, 'You can never connect the dots looking forward. You can only connect them looking backward.'</p>

<p>Trusting your instincts is something that'll probably never let you down. I'm pretty sure the dots will connect. I just can't see it right now! In the grand scheme of things, things will work out! I may sound like a lunatic trying to continuously reassure myself, but you could look back on your own life, and you'll see how even really bad things eventually led to something nice happening. It's statistically inevitable. After bad stuff happens, it's time for the good stuff, and hence the dots end up connecting. Sure, you may call it <em>karma</em>, religion or Justin Beiber if you're into that sort of a thing. But I'm sure a good mathematician could prove this <em>connecting of dots </em>Steve Jobs speaks about.</p>
