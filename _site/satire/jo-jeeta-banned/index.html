	<h2>Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikander to be Banned</h2>

	<p>The 1992 cult movie <em><a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104561/' title='Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar'>Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar</a></em> is all set to be banned in India, following repeated protests of parents, teachers and child-rights groups and activists.</p>

<p>The decision came after parents all over the country threatened to burn down the only movie theater in the country that still shows the movie, a 50 seater cinema at Baltana, Punjab.</p>

<p>One enraged parent says,</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>This is not the way we teach our kids. The title of the movie itself demonstrates that only the winner can be championed. Look at me, I was an average student, and now have an average salary. Yet, I can afford to drive my <a href='http://www.scootygals.com/' title='TVS Scooty'>Scooty</a> to work. Is that not that winning ? If we don&#8217;t teach our kids that being average is acceptable, they will all try to do extravagant things like not taking up engineering or medicine. How will my children be winners if they don&#8217;t take up one of those two professions?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As contentious as this parent&#8217;s claim may be, it certainly hasn&#8217;t deterred the rest of the Indian parents to joining in with the protests, and echoing their concerns.</p>

<p>Sources claim that certain factions of the Indian public have called that all broadcasters in the world should ban this movie, lest any children of the NRI community (or those of the Hindi-speaking foreign community) get affected.</p>

<p>Reacting to this, Aayesha Jhulka, one of the stars in the movie (that seemingly launched her career) says,</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>I can understand why Indian parents want to ban this movie.<br />However, I am totally against it because it&#8217;s one of the few movies on my Wikipedia page that has an entry darn&#8217;it!</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Education Minister of India, who prefers to remain anonymous, has reinforced that the decision is left to Pankaja Thakur, the CEO of the Censor Board of India. When we approached Mrs. Thakur, she made the following comments,</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>I know that we (The Censor Board of India) are notorious for censoring some of the most obscure things around. You know, I actually censored the two most important lines in the movie, &#8216;The Social Network&#8217;, so I could avoid giving it an &#8216;Adult&#8217; certificate and my daughter could watch it.<br />(pauses and raises hand for a high-five, to which our reporter reluctantly obliges)<br />Anyway, coming back to</em>Jo Jeeta<em>, yeah, consider it banned.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Meanwhile, the Indian intellectual community on Twitter has strongly condemned this ban, saying that banning a movie is not the Censor Board&#8217;s job anyway. In reply, Mrs. Pankaja Thakur created a Twitter account, but couldn&#8217;t manage to find a way to tweet. She then snail-mailed the following comment:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>They call themselves intellectuals. Can&#8217;t they see I&#8217;m effectively censoring the whole movie?</em></p>
</blockquote>
