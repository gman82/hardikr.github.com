   <title>Twenty Minutes on a Mumbai local train</title>
   <link href="http://blog.hardikr.com/india/mumbai-locals"/>
   <updated>2011-04-03T00:00:00+04:00</updated>
   <id>http://blog.hardikr.com/india/mumbai-locals</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A big part of the excitement of being a resident of Mumbai involves travelling by local trains. It would be an educated guess when I say that Mumbai boasts of one of the most extensive intra-city rail transport in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My commute to work involves a local train journey lasting approximately 15-20 minutes, enveloped between two bus rides. However, this 20 minute journey never ceases to be eventful. I arrive at Borivali Railway Station by bus at about 08:05, and my local train, which arrives at Platform #1, is not until 08:17. However, I&amp;#8217;m already all set for boarding. My wallet and mobile phone have been safely tucked into my backpack, which ironically, I wear on my front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This particular day was a special one. The previous night, India beat Pakistan in a World Cup semi-final clash, and the excitement and anticipation of a World Cup final match with Sri Lanka, and a potential second World Cup win was in the air. I&amp;#8217;m not such a huge fan of cricket in India (&lt;a href='http://www.livemint.com/2011/03/31204905/The-banality-of-the-Indian-cri.html'&gt;here&amp;#8217;s why&lt;/a&gt;), but I am happy for a billion citizens of a crazy country. Everybody&amp;#8217;s talking about how Sachin Tendulkar missed out on his century, and going into excruciatingly graphic detail of how they would treat Shahid Afridi, the Pakistan team captain, for dismissing Tendulkar on 85 runs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;We respect him for his comments after the game, but he is a Pakistani after all. We will not spare him with our words&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;, says a young man next to me, when I asked him about how he felt about Afridi. People are scrambling to the newspaper stand and buying a copy of Times of India, the highest circulated English-language daily in India. Everybody wants to be the first to know all the facts about the match, and this includes people who watched the whole ~9 hour match.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;Yes, I watched the match yesterday. I malingered, but I don&amp;#8217;t think my boss bought it. Later I realized even he was at home, and we had a good laugh, we called Pakistanis names and it was sorted. &amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;, explains one of the thousands of youngsters who work in call-centers in the city of Mumbai. He has an unsurprisingly familiar fake American accent, and he goes on to explain that this was one of the days he wishes he had a late night shift instead of a morning shift, since the leave he took would cost him a full thirtieth of his paycheck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some people who won&amp;#8217;t buy a newspaper, and will make it a point of peeking over the shoulders of people who actually purchased newspapers and trying to read whatever they can. This is a particularly irritating bourgeois cliché in India. A couple of newspaper owners snap out at the &lt;a href='http://i.imgur.com/EP6C2.jpg'&gt;peekers&lt;/a&gt;, asking them to get their own newspapers, or just have plain-old patience. Sharing of resources has never been a problem in Mumbai. In fact, you&amp;#8217;re expected to share almost anything and everything. Personal space, newspapers, a seat meant for two with five other people. You name it, you gotta share it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s a loud honk, and the atmosphere created by the crowd borders on the frenetic. As the train slowly enters the station, there&amp;#8217;s a flurry of activity on the platform. Even though there&amp;#8217;s enough place for everybody, there&amp;#8217;s this sort of hurry everybody is in, to get inside the train. Even before the train has come to a complete halt, hundreds have already boarded and occupied seats. The crowd often crosses the line of hooliganism, and one or two injuries on a train ride are almost a given.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I manage to shove my way into a Second Class compartment, which is separated from a First Class compartment by a steel grill. This grill almost feels like a symbolic barrier between the upper class and the middle class of Mumbai. But apparently, it&amp;#8217;s much more complicated than that. &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;I have to get into Second Class. I have a month-long First Class pass, but nowadays it is filled with people who don&amp;#8217;t even have First Class tickets &amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;, explains a kid standing next to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s a warning message played on the speaker system in the train, about how to handle unidentified baggage. The message is usually played once each in Marathi, Hindi and English. But today, it&amp;#8217;s being played in Marathi all the three times. A South Indian chap next to me asks what the message was about. I reply, &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;If you see any unidentified police, just call the nearest baggage.&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He looks at me, confused, almost as confused as when he heard the message in Marathi. I realize my mistake and both of us burst out laughing. &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;I got it, haha&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;, he says, and shuffles into the crowd and disappears. It eerily reminds me of the biology lesson in which an amoeba ate a food particle, which got absorbed into it and became a part of the amoeba.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The crowd in a single bogie of the train has this sort of hierarchy, which is inapparent at first, but once you notice it, it&amp;#8217;s pretty obvious. The young, and still pretending to be young, of the lower-middle class stand right on the exits of the bogie, often hanging perilously close to the electric poles that fly past when the train travels at it&amp;#8217;s top speed of 60 kmph. Then come the class of people who&amp;#8217;ll literally kill for a seat on the train, even when their journey lasts only around 5 minutes, and would not sacrifice their seats for a physically disabled person who managed to get into the general compartment only because the physically disabled compartment was filled with physically able people. We then reach the MBA/IIT examination preparation generation, who&amp;#8217;re always buried in their books even when there&amp;#8217;s hardly any place to stand. If it&amp;#8217;s dark, they&amp;#8217;ll squint and try to read a few pages. But, you gotta do what you gotta do to fulfill your parents&amp;#8217; dreams. Then there are the agitated people. They love to start altercations for the smallest of things, and make it a point to make a scene out of otherwise trivial matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;Ganpatti bappa, morya.&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt; (praise the lord Ganpati), is the shout from the crowd as the train starts moving from Borivali station. &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;They seem to think that taking a deity&amp;#8217;s name will balance out all the crap that they do later on in the day. I tell you, this karma is a bad concept to judge people at the end of the day. Some wrongs just cannot be righted&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;, explains an elderly gentleman. He almost seems disassociated from everybody else in the train, a deranged and dark figure looming amongst a thousand sweaty souls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He introduces himself as Lavkare, and says, &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;I lost interest in cricket when Azhar was caught match fixing. He was my idol.&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt; He&amp;#8217;s 65, and still has to work for a living. His only son passed away a few years ago, and his daughter is married off and not in touch with him. &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;Sometimes it&amp;#8217;s amazing how much you have to do, to get two meals in a day. I&amp;#8217;ve been denied my retirement money for five years now, and the&lt;/em&gt;(redacted)_ bank seems to enjoy having me over. They give me tea and biscuits, but when I ask for my money they give me random papers and give excuses. Just last year, I unknowingly signed an agreement saying I would not demand the retirement money before I was 70. I had not brought my spectacles that day and they told me the papers were about releasing the retirement funds. I got all excited and signed them without even reading.&amp;#8221;_ My heart does a flip as I hear these words. I cannot begin to imagine what he must be going through, and make a mental note to be thankful for the relatively pleasurable life I lead. It amazed me at how quickly he connected to me; maybe he just needed someone to talk to?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kandivali is the next station, and Lavkare is literally thrown off as he attempts to alight from the train. There&amp;#8217;s a clash in between the people getting off the train and people attempting to board the train. He falls on the platform floor. He seems hurt, but not a single person stops to even spare a glance. I jump off the train to help him out, but he waves his hands frantically, indicating I get back on the train. Nevertheless, it&amp;#8217;s too late, and after a halt of around 10-12 seconds, the train is moving. Lavkare smiles and says, &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;Son, these trains never wait for anyone. You may be lying on the tracks and they&amp;#8217;ll run you over so that another thousand people can get to work on time. &amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much as I would love to hear him out, I have to head for work and I board the next train, bidding goodbye to Lavkare, who&amp;#8217;ll remain a memorable acquaintance. Malad Station is the next stop. Here, the amount of people who get on the train is relatively lower, and now I&amp;#8217;m well positioned at the exit to disembark at my destination, the next station, Goregaon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the train slows down at Goregaon, people are already jumping into the bogie/compartment, and their momentum is pushing us (the people who need to alight at Goregaon) further back, while the people behind us shove our backs with their elbows, as if that&amp;#8217;s helping the situation. In the end, I have to do the same, and shove the people in front of me off the train, some of them are people who&amp;#8217;d just boarded at Goregaon. They give me a mean glare, and a couple of them shout obscenities at the me and the people behind me; but what was I supposed to do? I think to myself, &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;Fine. You label me, I label you&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;. It was their fault that they didn&amp;#8217;t let the people get down first, which is usually the accepted protocol to minimize collisions. I don&amp;#8217;t bother even sparing a look back, and am already climbing the stairs which will lead me out of the station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the corner of the station, there&amp;#8217;s a man holding a small child in his arms, along with a woman. &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;Excuse me sir, may I have a word?&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;, he calls out to me. This is not the first time I&amp;#8217;ve been summoned by a supposed family. I knew how this encounter was going to go down, but I wanted to amuse myself, and played along. He explains how he had come to Mumbai to find work, and how he has to head back to his village, and has no money to purchase the tickets to do the same. I smile, and say that I have no money (which is partly true as I&amp;#8217;m two weeks into work and haven&amp;#8217;t got a paycheck yet.). He quickly resorts to begging, and falls at my feet. This maneuver pushes me off the edge and I turn around and walk away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ever-present &lt;em&gt;tabla&lt;/em&gt; playing beggar is playing a new and popular song today (for those better informed, &lt;em&gt;Sheila ki Jawani&lt;/em&gt;), which is quite interesting; even he feels the need to keep up with the ever-changing popular songs. As I am leaving the station, a little boy pesters me for some money, and I avoid him. He follows me around for a minute. When I finally turn to him to apprise him of his failed attempts at begging, I see his left hand holding a mobile phone to his ear. He&amp;#8217;s talking away and smiling. I&amp;#8217;m quite amused and disgusted at the same time, and proceed to my bus which would take me to the office, away from this madness, only for it to begin in the evening on the way back home. But what the hell, I&amp;#8217;m loving it. (Nope, McDonalds, I&amp;#8217;m not paying you a single rupee)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PS: If you&amp;#8217;ve never travelled by train in Mumbai, my train route can be spotted &lt;a href='http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;msa=0&amp;amp;msid=203734048420848874241.00049ff47418895d99014&amp;amp;ll=19.195757,72.906303&amp;amp;spn=0.173465,0.308647&amp;amp;z=12'&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Apparently, Eightbit.me has hijacked my Twitter profile photo!</title>
   <link href="http://blog.hardikr.com/tech/eightbit-hijack"/>
   <updated>2011-03-26T00:00:00+04:00</updated>
   <id>http://blog.hardikr.com/tech/eightbit-hijack</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I logged into Twitter today and realized that my profile picture had got changed to an avatar I had created on &lt;a href=&quot;http://eightbit.me&quot;&gt;eightbit.me&lt;/a&gt; a few days ago. That's weird! I do not remember doing such a thing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first instinct was to check whether other people who had used eightbit.me had suffered a similar fate, and around eight of the ten people I checked out on eightbit using their profile randomizer had their avatars set as their Twitter profile photo. I don't know if that proves anything or not, I'm just stating my observations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll be the first one to admit it, I did not verify what sort of permissions eightbit demanded at the time I approved it, and I presumed it was just an interface for signing in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, it seems that they've hijacked my Twitter profile photo. What's next? It reminds me of that post on Hacker News whose title went something like 'oAuth will kill your kids'. I can't find it right now, but I really want to go back and read that article again.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A Time for New Mistakes</title>
   <link href="http://blog.hardikr.com/startups/mistakes"/>
   <updated>2011-03-23T00:00:00+04:00</updated>
   <id>http://blog.hardikr.com/startups/mistakes</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Most startup people are ex-disgruntled folks, having grown beards of experience in their jobs which they held for years and they were so sick of, attempting to quit their jobs day-in and day-out like it was a terrible addiction, and finally picking up the courage to do so. Alas, all those hours of slogging away at work, coding into the night for your company's new projects, teaming up with brilliant and quirky programmers, getting admonished for making mistakes in the production release of the code-base; all these things come to an end. Time and experience has made them the wiser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They've found a new life. They've rediscovered what's it like to be a workaholic, but only this time they enjoy doing it. They've discovered a new passion ( it's usually photography ) , and they've started to finally love what they do for a living.  They're ready to sacrifice anything and everything for their startup to succeed. Every minute spent not doing anything else counts to making the startup a success. Some founders even make corn-flakes to make their ends meet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such traits amongst startup folk are quite common. The process of quitting your job and starting a startup is often called &quot;&lt;em&gt;taking the plunge&quot;&lt;/em&gt;, giving an impression of a thrill-ride, an exciting jump into periods of uncertainty and freedom from the shackles of the corporate world. All quite true, since when you're doing a startup, you literally feel all these feelings I've just described. The free-fall into a world of entrepreneurship can be scary and intimidating, but which &lt;em&gt;plunge&lt;/em&gt; isn't ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, why would someone go in the opposite direction? Why would someone attempt a startup after graduation, know that it's the right thing to do, and still turn to a job ? The startup failed ? Sure ! But that provides more motivation to me than anything else!  The result of a month-long self-introspection, all &lt;em&gt;while&lt;/em&gt; coding the next phase of my startup, was that I was never destined to work in a corporate environment. That's just not me. I'll not end up doing that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, there's a big difference in the '&lt;em&gt;end up doing a job'&lt;/em&gt; for the rest of my life, and doing a job to gain relevant experience. And I did feel the hit, I did feel something missing, in-spite of my &lt;a href=&quot;http://lpad.in&quot;&gt;mentor&lt;/a&gt; doing everything he could to keep me on track. Towards the end of the fifth month, a combination of restlessness, lack of clarity, lack of self-esteem (couldn't go for Masters, and no current income), homesickness (probably induced by staying away from home for the last four years) and a bunch of other really complicated stuff gave way to me going home for the aforementioned month-long much-needed break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see this as just a break from my startup. My instinct told me I needed a break, and I took it. It may last months, or even years. But I'll be back. As much as I'm enjoying my position as web developer with my new employer, where I get to work on really exciting new technologies and stuff, I know that it's not my cup of tea for too long. I can never, ever do a job for my whole life! ( Please don't fire me yet :P ) .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for now, it's time to make a bunch of new mistakes. That's what's life's all about (three apostrophe s' consecutively) ! I knew I could not learn from others' mistakes so passively. I had to make some of them on my own. But the beautiful and the best part is the grand scheme of things. Remember what Steve Jobs said, 'You can never connect the dots looking forward. You can only connect them looking backward.'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trusting your instincts is something that'll probably never let you down. I'm pretty sure the dots will connect. I just can't see it right now! In the grand scheme of things, things will work out! I may sound like a lunatic trying to continuously reassure myself, but you could look back on your own life, and you'll see how even really bad things eventually led to something nice happening. It's statistically inevitable. After bad stuff happens, it's time for the good stuff, and hence the dots end up connecting. Sure, you may call it &lt;em&gt;karma&lt;/em&gt;, religion or Justin Beiber if you're into that sort of a thing. But I'm sure a good mathematician could prove this &lt;em&gt;connecting of dots &lt;/em&gt;Steve Jobs speaks about.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A Week with BlackBerry</title>
   <link href="http://blog.hardikr.com/tech/testing-blackberry"/>
   <updated>2011-03-15T00:00:00+04:00</updated>
   <id>http://blog.hardikr.com/tech/testing-blackberry</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've now spent over a week with the Blackberry Curve 9300, which is the first in the Curve series to have 3G and GPS.. I guess at around 300$, that was a decent buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my first smartphone (I know!!), but I am in a position to compare BlackBerry with iOS, since I've owned an iPod touch for a good while now, and have extensively used the App Store and all the great apps that come with it. I'll be talking about BlackBerry iOS 5.0 and Apple iOS 4.2.1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First, the obvious and the ugly&lt;/strong&gt;. The BB App Store sucks. I'm thankful for my iPod touch without which apps like Instapaper, Angry Birds, TinyWings and $_your_favorite_app would only be a distant dream.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prominent apps in the BB App Store are the social media giants: Facebook, Twitter, FourSquare and those apps are god-awful. The Facebook app is especially made to make sharing as difficult as possible. The Twitter app looks like it's doing a favor to me in terms of the UI/UX, and geotagging seems to be a feature missing (or very difficult to find, at best). The FourSquare just about passes the mark, but it often fails to connect to it's mother ship, even when the BB data services are working fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing worth mentioning here would be that BB allows access to the App Store, and usage of these mainstream apps only over it's data service, and they DO NOT work over a wireless connection. It's as blatant a way of saying, &quot;Either pay for our data connection every month, or get lost&quot;. They expect me, as a smartphone buyer, not to access the basic features of a smartphone, aka social media (which they actually use to sell this product) over Wi-Fi hotspots, which are fast becoming the major way of accessing the Internet at home and at work. This decision has really set a rebellious anti-BlackBerry sentiment inside me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moving on to the slightly better features. &lt;/strong&gt;My primary motive to buy the BB was to stay in touch better with my parents - who stay apart - and of course with other friends. When my parents get a BB, the BlackBerry Messenger (BBM) provides them a seamless and cheap way of keeping in touch with me. I really love the concept of a mobile P2P network, and BBM becomes a really dirt cheap way of keeping in touch with the many circles of friends I have. I hate spending time on Facebook, and I see BBM becoming one of the major modes of communication with my friends who have a BB. What about those who don't have a BB? Good old e-mail and SMS!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The best part about the BlackBerry experience:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;The way the BB handles e-mail is quite unparalleled. With it's push technology, superior attachment handling features, and seamless integration with major e-mail services, this is really the selling point of the BlackBerry when it comes to email power users. Logging on to GMail and replying to e-mails is another thing I hate doing, and it really simplifies this a lot for me.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BB messages application integrates SMS, Email, Facebook and Twitter in an uncluttered fashion, and it's good to have all my notifications in one place. This is BlackBerry's forte, where it's so smooth and makes my life much easier. The iOS team can learn a bunch from the BB guys. I've used the native iOS mail application, and it leaves much to be desired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On Multitasking: &lt;/strong&gt;This is the area where the BB beats the iOS hands-down. I'm talking zero-lag multi-tasking of &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;number of apps compared to the sluggish multitasking of iOS 4. The BB has not showed a hint of slowing down with over 15-20 apps running simultaneously, and switching amongst them is a breeze. The iOS could do &lt;em&gt;much, much&lt;/em&gt; better here (and it sure is poised to, with the processors becoming faster and even more powerful.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, you cannot really compare iOS to BlackBerry as the audience is completely different. BlackBerry caters to two major classes of people - First, the age group of 13-21. Second, the working class who make their living on answering e-mails. Whereas the iOS has an almost zero entry barrier and I've seen everyone from the kid, the mom and the business guy effectively utilize an iPhone. However, it costs a fortune in India, and I don't see it capturing the Indian market like it has in the West, unless they reduce the damn prices.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Egypt, India</title>
   <link href="http://blog.hardikr.com/india/egypt-india"/>
   <updated>2011-03-01T00:00:00+04:00</updated>
   <id>http://blog.hardikr.com/india/egypt-india</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Keeping in tune with my last post about &lt;a href='http://blog.hardikr.com/startups/call-me'&gt;verbs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;pulling off an ‘Egypt’&lt;/em&gt; seems like a acceptable phrase that India can aspire to. Let’s take a look at some of the causes of the Egyptian Revolution of 2011. Let’s stack up Egypt’s problems alongside India’s (with utmost respect towards Egypt, I know it was much worse off than India is now, but just for the sake or argument). According to Wikipedia,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…over a million people were protesting to demand the overthrow of the Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, an end to corruption and police repression, and democratic reforms of the political system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corruption: ✓&lt;br /&gt;Police Repression: ✓&lt;br /&gt;Democratic Reforms Required: ✓&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grievances of Egyptian protesters have focused on legal and political issues including police brutality, state of emergency laws, lack of free elections and freedom of speech, and uncontrollable corruption, as well as economic issues including high unemployment, food price inflation, and low minimum wages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legal and political issues: ✓&lt;br /&gt;Police Brutality: ✓&lt;br /&gt;State of Emergency Laws: x&lt;br /&gt;Lack of Free Elections: ✓ (Most of the members of parliament just inherit the posts from the previous generations of their family. I would hardly call that free elections.)&lt;br /&gt;Lack of Freedom of Speech: ✓&lt;br /&gt;Uncontrollable Corruption: ✓&lt;br /&gt;High Unemployment: - (Admittedly, India did decently well to control the effect of the recession.)&lt;br /&gt;Food Price Inflation: ✓&lt;br /&gt;Low Minimum Wages: ✓&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, India has a lot of things going for it when the leaders claim that the inflation rate is a sign of economic growth. I don’t buy it, however. And Economics Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen doesn’t either, who was Johnny-on-the-spot &lt;a href='http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hPEP4v8X3uqX4vQ-KSlAVXxbqY0A?docId=CNG.26f85a77fe573d0130a10eb475c1a65e.c41'&gt;recently&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sen argued that New Delhi was far behind in the growth race, but more importantly it lagged in other criteria that showed real living standards were far inferior in India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life expectancy at birth in China was 73.5 years compared with 64.4 years in India; Infant mortality rate is 50 per thousand in India and just 17 in China, and the under-five mortality rate is 66 for Indians and 19 for the Chinese.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s adult literacy rate is 94 percent, compared with India’s 65 percent, and mean years of schooling in India is 4.4 years, compared with 7.5 years in China, he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Almost half of our children are undernourished compared with a very tiny proportion in China,” Sen added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, it’s not just me who agrees that this obsession of thinking that India is actually growing is unhealthy, unfounded and unfair to the middle and lower class, who pay taxes and die respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve said it over and over again, when a country cannot stop it’s children from dying, that means something’s wrong. While we’re spending millions on our defense research to launch &lt;a href='http://news.google.co.in/news/url?sa=t&amp;amp;ct2=in/0_0_s_0_0_t&amp;amp;ct3=MAA4AEgAUABgAWoCaW4&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNGwSh9GKChv4xi-cOLtqmY8CMYjfw&amp;amp;cid=8797660069560&amp;amp;ei=rohbTaCbK8G3cKXNzN0C&amp;amp;rt=SEARCH&amp;amp;vm=STANDARD&amp;amp;url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/DRDO-develops-mosquito-repellent-cream/articleshow/7496555.cms'&gt;mosquito repellent creams&lt;/a&gt;, more than 2.35 million under the age of five &lt;a href='http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/11/13/us-india-deaths-child-idUSTRE6AC01Y20101113'&gt;die&lt;/a&gt; every year (60% of them from easily avoidable causes.) Does &lt;em&gt;anybody else&lt;/em&gt; see a problem here?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let’s see, what options do we have to set things right? I’m actually at a loss of words when I think about the arduous process to get anything done from the government of India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s pull of an Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>Call Me, or How Becoiming a Verb is a Sign of Success</title>
   <link href="http://blog.hardikr.com/startups/call-me"/>
   <updated>2011-02-09T00:00:00+04:00</updated>
   <id>http://blog.hardikr.com/startups/call-me</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever noticed, many of the successful technologies that have emerged over the past century, have become verbs of their own right, or become the de-facto ‘direct object’ of an &lt;a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verb#Valency'&gt;intransitive verb&lt;/a&gt;. First we have some of the golden oldies,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;Call me&amp;#8221;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#8220;Fax me&amp;#8221;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#8220;E-mail me&amp;#8221; / &amp;#8220;Check my e-mail&amp;#8221;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#8220;Watching TV&amp;#8221;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#8220;Digg it&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And today, some new players that have turned proper nouns into verbs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;Chatting with ..&amp;#8221;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#8220;Google it&amp;#8221;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#8220;Facebook me&amp;#8221; / &amp;#8220;Surfing Facebook&amp;#8221;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#8220;Tweet me&amp;#8221; / &amp;#8220;TweetUp&amp;#8221;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#8220;Dropbox the file&amp;#8221;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#8220;Instapaper it&amp;#8221;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#8220;Reddit it&amp;#8221;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#8220;Radbox it&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verbs have this strange force about them. There’s an inherent sense of authority/action about them that tends to catch on. A psycholinguist would definitely be in a better position to explain, if and why, verbs are words of power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, some technologies/products are almost incapable of becoming a verb, say the iPhone, and it obviously doesn’t make it any less of a success story. But, this is just something interesting to keep in mind while marketing your product !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclaimer: I write this as a marketing layman. So, don’t blame me if you market your startup as a verb and it doesn’t work out ;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikander to be Banned</title>
   <link href="http://blog.hardikr.com/satire/jo-jeeta-banned"/>
   <updated>2011-01-25T00:00:00+04:00</updated>
   <id>http://blog.hardikr.com/satire/jo-jeeta-banned</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The 1992 cult movie &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104561/' title='Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar'&gt;Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is all set to be banned in India, following repeated protests of parents, teachers and child-rights groups and activists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decision came after parents all over the country threatened to burn down the only movie theater in the country that still shows the movie, a 50 seater cinema at Baltana, Punjab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One enraged parent says,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is not the way we teach our kids. The title of the movie itself demonstrates that only the winner can be championed. Look at me, I was an average student, and now have an average salary. Yet, I can afford to drive my &lt;a href='http://www.scootygals.com/' title='TVS Scooty'&gt;Scooty&lt;/a&gt; to work. Is that not that winning ? If we don&amp;#8217;t teach our kids that being average is acceptable, they will all try to do extravagant things like not taking up engineering or medicine. How will my children be winners if they don&amp;#8217;t take up one of those two professions?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As contentious as this parent&amp;#8217;s claim may be, it certainly hasn&amp;#8217;t deterred the rest of the Indian parents to joining in with the protests, and echoing their concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sources claim that certain factions of the Indian public have called that all broadcasters in the world should ban this movie, lest any children of the NRI community (or those of the Hindi-speaking foreign community) get affected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reacting to this, Aayesha Jhulka, one of the stars in the movie (that seemingly launched her career) says,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I can understand why Indian parents want to ban this movie.&lt;br /&gt;However, I am totally against it because it&amp;#8217;s one of the few movies on my Wikipedia page that has an entry darn&amp;#8217;it!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Education Minister of India, who prefers to remain anonymous, has reinforced that the decision is left to Pankaja Thakur, the CEO of the Censor Board of India. When we approached Mrs. Thakur, she made the following comments,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I know that we (The Censor Board of India) are notorious for censoring some of the most obscure things around. You know, I actually censored the two most important lines in the movie, &amp;#8216;The Social Network&amp;#8217;, so I could avoid giving it an &amp;#8216;Adult&amp;#8217; certificate and my daughter could watch it.&lt;br /&gt;(pauses and raises hand for a high-five, to which our reporter reluctantly obliges)&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, coming back to&lt;/em&gt;Jo Jeeta&lt;em&gt;, yeah, consider it banned.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the Indian intellectual community on Twitter has strongly condemned this ban, saying that banning a movie is not the Censor Board&amp;#8217;s job anyway. In reply, Mrs. Pankaja Thakur created a Twitter account, but couldn&amp;#8217;t manage to find a way to tweet. She then snail-mailed the following comment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;They call themselves intellectuals. Can&amp;#8217;t they see I&amp;#8217;m effectively censoring the whole movie?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content>

   <title>Something's Wrong</title>
   <link href="http://blog.hardikr.com/india/somethings-wrong"/>
   <updated>2011-01-18T00:00:00+04:00</updated>
   <id>http://blog.hardikr.com/india/somethings-wrong</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The last few months have been really, really crazy. Just look around and you can see disruption everywhere! Firstly, there were news that a viral Facebook app called threewords.me is about to be acquired just after a couple of days of launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheezburger network just raised 30 million dollars.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WTF DO I DOEZ WIF 30 MILLION DOLLARS?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something's not quite right. The Silicon Valley has gone crazy. I can accept that a &lt;a href=&quot;http://posterous.com&quot;&gt;Tumblr clone&lt;/a&gt; somehow managed to get accepted into &lt;a href=&quot;http://ycombinator.com&quot;&gt;YC&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;, but seriously, Cheezburger network raising 30 million dollars?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not just the Valley, but here in the East too.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chinese mothers claim they're &lt;a href=&quot;http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704111504576059713528698754.html&quot;&gt;superior&lt;/a&gt; at what they do (sure, if what you do is, never mind... ).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pakistan is under some sort of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://majorlyprofound.wordpress.com/2011/01/18/birth-of-a-liberal-pakistan-approximately-after-70-years-of-screwing/&quot;&gt;revolution&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tunisia has already had it's revolution. And to think of it, one suicide sparked this movement. In India, even 17000+ farmers dying a year does nothing to provoke the masses. Yet, we think of ourselves to be the most pleasant community in the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ditto with Egypt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;India's per-capita income is now &lt;a href=&quot;http://devdata.worldbank.org/AAG/ind_aag.pdf&quot;&gt;over $1000&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(pdf). However, 80% of the population lives under &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livemint.com/articles/2007/10/16235421/80-of-Indians-live-on-less-th.html&quot;&gt;$2 per day&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Here in India, the onion has become one of the most prized commodities that a middle class man can be proud to own. Coming home Mr. Kumar? You can be sure to have onions in every dish, coz we ain't no poor middle-class people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The fuel price hikes are bringing out the worst in motorists&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The IN Congress, earlier the hallmark of democracy in India, has become a play-doll, doing nothing but holding meetings and deciding which ministers to keep on the pay-roll.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, in India, some things are still the same, and it's strangely relieving (though highly frustrating).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Politicians are still siphoning off our money. Damn you fake democracy!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;India still considers itself worthy of hosting a &lt;a href=&quot;http://indiatoday.intoday.in/site/Story/126207/Sports/india-may-host-2026-fifa-world-cup-blatter.html&quot;&gt;FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt;, after what happened in the CWG (ugh!).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Religious people are still dying in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&amp;amp;source=news&amp;amp;cd=8&amp;amp;ved=0CH4QqQIwBw&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dnaindia.com%2Findia%2Freport_sabarimala-stampede-tragic-memories-that-would-remain-forever_1495936&amp;amp;ei=Qzc1TYyoOZGkugOgwKngCw&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNGx5-GnpSXoU5UzrhliyqOuuo-EEw&amp;amp;sig2=PII15uwRFIIKnqXk_yPq7g&quot;&gt;stampedes&lt;/a&gt;. It's frikkin 2011 people!! There's something known as management! And common sense!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rahul Gandhi still doesn't have any &lt;a href=&quot;http://rahulgandhiachievements.com/&quot;&gt;achievements&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(apart from thinking he's young at 40).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._Karunanidhi&quot;&gt;People who cannot walk&lt;/a&gt;, but yet find time to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._Karunanidhi#Controversies&quot;&gt;do stuff&lt;/a&gt;, are still running states.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shah Rukh is still trying his luck at &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zor_Ka_Jhatka:_Total_Wipeout&quot;&gt;game-shows&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(which is also 'inspired' by an American TV show. Seriously, can't Indians come up with anything original? )&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Indian institutes of higher education are still deemed as elite and premier institutions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What in God's name is going on? However, I must admit, I love civic disorder! People doubting their own governments? That's what I'm talking about!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Why Flipkart Rocks</title>
   <link href="http://blog.hardikr.com/startups/flipkart"/>
   <updated>2011-01-13T00:00:00+04:00</updated>
   <id>http://blog.hardikr.com/startups/flipkart</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I got this e-mail from Flipkart:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hello,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We recently sent you an Availability notification for the book &quot;Liar's Poker: The Great Powers, Yugoslavia And The Wars Of The Future&quot; &amp;nbsp;(&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.flipkart.com/liar-poker-michel-collon-great-book-0965691667&quot;&gt;http://www.flipkart.com/liar-poker-michel-collon-great-book-0965691667&lt;/a&gt;) as earlier requested by you on December 14, 2010.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regrettably, the notification was due to an error at our end. &amp;nbsp;The issue was fixed earlier today and needless to say, will not be repeated. Our apologies if we got your hopes up with regards to a book that you had long been waiting for. Be assured, we will continue to maintain a record of your request(s). The next time we send you an Availability email, you can be sure the book will be available for ordering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincere apologies again from all of us at Flipkart.com. Do let us know if we can be of any further assistance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards,&lt;br /&gt;Flipkart Customer Support Team&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I was left open-mouthed when I read this ! They're actually sending me an e-mail apologizing for &lt;strong&gt;getting my hopes up&lt;/strong&gt;! Apart from providing wonderful books which I could never otherwise find in India, they have this sort of customer support.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This, is why Flipkart rocks. Kudos! I think you're poised for a hell of an exit when Amazon enters India and acquires you guys.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Hacker News Classic</title>
   <link href="http://blog.hardikr.com/hn/hn-classic"/>
   <updated>2011-01-10T00:00:00+04:00</updated>
   <id>http://blog.hardikr.com/hn/hn-classic</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hacker News Classic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For newer members of Hacker News (like me), HN Classic is a lesser known feature. You can view it&amp;nbsp;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://news.ycombinator.com/classic&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is it? It shows the front-page with number of votes cast from accounts that are at least a year old. Why ? PG says, almost two years ago, in &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=607271&quot;&gt;this submission&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I wanted to see if there had been any visible decrease in quality. Doesn't look like it. There's surprisingly little difference between this and the regular frontpage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even today, there doesn't seem to be much of a difference between the Classic page and the regular front page. HN probably has a really high number of lurkers, who don't bother registering/upvoting. Also, HN has been around for a long time, so a relatively higher number of accounts are older than a year. That probably dilutes the measure PG was looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Submissions with Minimum Votes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we come to the Minimum votes feature. You can view the front-page with submissions that have at least a minimum number of votes that you can specify. Example: &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.ycombinator.com/over?points=100&quot;&gt;http://news.ycombinator.com/over?points=100&lt;/a&gt; will return posts with minimum of 100 votes. An interesting experiment is visiting the above link, and seeing how many of the thirty you have already visited. If it's greater than 20, you can be sure you're up-to-date with the latest in tech/startup. (in fact, HN was earlier known as &lt;em&gt;Startup News&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Karma Thresholds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After you reach a certain threshold ( 200-300 I think), you can edit the color of the website header. At 500 karma, you get down-voting. At a higher karma level, you can create Polls. Also, I've read somewhere that beyond a really high threshold you can even edit the text 'Hacker News' in the header !&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hacker News Mirror&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PG hosts a mirror at &lt;a href=&quot;http://apps.ycombinator.com/news&quot;&gt;http://apps.ycombinator.com/news&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;, in case you live in a weird-ass place that's blocked news.YC .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E-mail Notifications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use Notifo to get notified when somebody responds to your thread. Just put your Notifo username in the appropriate place in your HN profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bookmarking Stories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever wished you could bookmark that clever hack to use for your next project. Sure, there's Instapaper, but if you just upvote it, it'll appear in your saved stories in your profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delay your comment&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever posted a comment only to find out the original poster has edited his/her comment meanwhile? Use the delay field in your profile to make your comments appear after a short while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's it I guess. You probably knew most of the stuff above. If you didn't, well, now you do!&lt;/p&gt;
