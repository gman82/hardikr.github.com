	<h2>A Week with BlackBerry</h2>

<p>I've now spent over a week with the Blackberry Curve 9300, which is the first in the Curve series to have 3G and GPS.. I guess at around 300$, that was a decent buy.</p>
<p>This is my first smartphone (I know!!), but I am in a position to compare BlackBerry with iOS, since I've owned an iPod touch for a good while now, and have extensively used the App Store and all the great apps that come with it. I'll be talking about BlackBerry iOS 5.0 and Apple iOS 4.2.1</p>
<p><strong>First, the obvious and the ugly</strong>. The BB App Store sucks. I'm thankful for my iPod touch without which apps like Instapaper, Angry Birds, TinyWings and $_your_favorite_app would only be a distant dream.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The prominent apps in the BB App Store are the social media giants: Facebook, Twitter, FourSquare and those apps are god-awful. The Facebook app is especially made to make sharing as difficult as possible. The Twitter app looks like it's doing a favor to me in terms of the UI/UX, and geotagging seems to be a feature missing (or very difficult to find, at best). The FourSquare just about passes the mark, but it often fails to connect to it's mother ship, even when the BB data services are working fine.<br /><br />Another thing worth mentioning here would be that BB allows access to the App Store, and usage of these mainstream apps only over it's data service, and they DO NOT work over a wireless connection. It's as blatant a way of saying, "Either pay for our data connection every month, or get lost". They expect me, as a smartphone buyer, not to access the basic features of a smartphone, aka social media (which they actually use to sell this product) over Wi-Fi hotspots, which are fast becoming the major way of accessing the Internet at home and at work. This decision has really set a rebellious anti-BlackBerry sentiment inside me.</p>
<p><strong>Moving on to the slightly better features. </strong>My primary motive to buy the BB was to stay in touch better with my parents - who stay apart - and of course with other friends. When my parents get a BB, the BlackBerry Messenger (BBM) provides them a seamless and cheap way of keeping in touch with me. I really love the concept of a mobile P2P network, and BBM becomes a really dirt cheap way of keeping in touch with the many circles of friends I have. I hate spending time on Facebook, and I see BBM becoming one of the major modes of communication with my friends who have a BB. What about those who don't have a BB? Good old e-mail and SMS!</p>
<p><strong>The best part about the BlackBerry experience:&nbsp;</strong>The way the BB handles e-mail is quite unparalleled. With it's push technology, superior attachment handling features, and seamless integration with major e-mail services, this is really the selling point of the BlackBerry when it comes to email power users. Logging on to GMail and replying to e-mails is another thing I hate doing, and it really simplifies this a lot for me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The BB messages application integrates SMS, Email, Facebook and Twitter in an uncluttered fashion, and it's good to have all my notifications in one place. This is BlackBerry's forte, where it's so smooth and makes my life much easier. The iOS team can learn a bunch from the BB guys. I've used the native iOS mail application, and it leaves much to be desired.</p>
<p><strong>On Multitasking: </strong>This is the area where the BB beats the iOS hands-down. I'm talking zero-lag multi-tasking of <em>n</em>&nbsp;number of apps compared to the sluggish multitasking of iOS 4. The BB has not showed a hint of slowing down with over 15-20 apps running simultaneously, and switching amongst them is a breeze. The iOS could do <em>much, much</em> better here (and it sure is poised to, with the processors becoming faster and even more powerful.)</p>
<p>Overall, you cannot really compare iOS to BlackBerry as the audience is completely different. BlackBerry caters to two major classes of people - First, the age group of 13-21. Second, the working class who make their living on answering e-mails. Whereas the iOS has an almost zero entry barrier and I've seen everyone from the kid, the mom and the business guy effectively utilize an iPhone. However, it costs a fortune in India, and I don't see it capturing the Indian market like it has in the West, unless they reduce the damn prices.</p>
