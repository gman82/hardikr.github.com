	<h2><a href="http://blog.hardikr.com/satire/jo-jeeta-banned">Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikander to be Banned</a></h2>
	<div class="post-meta">
		<div class="meta-date">January 25, 2011
	</div>
	<p>The 1992 cult movie <em><a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104561/' title='Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar'>Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar</a></em> is all set to be banned in India, following repeated protests of parents, teachers and child-rights groups and activists.</p>

<p>The decision came after parents all over the country threatened to burn down the only movie theater in the country that still shows the movie, a 50 seater cinema at Baltana, Punjab.</p>

<p>One enraged parent says,</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>This is not the way we teach our kids. The title of the movie itself demonstrates that only the winner can be championed. Look at me, I was an average student, and now have an average salary. Yet, I can afford to drive my <a href='http://www.scootygals.com/' title='TVS Scooty'>Scooty</a> to work. Is that not that winning ? If we don&#8217;t teach our kids that being average is acceptable, they will all try to do extravagant things like not taking up engineering or medicine. How will my children be winners if they don&#8217;t take up one of those two professions?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As contentious as this parent&#8217;s claim may be, it certainly hasn&#8217;t deterred the rest of the Indian parents to joining in with the protests, and echoing their concerns.</p>

<p>Sources claim that certain factions of the Indian public have called that all broadcasters in the world should ban this movie, lest any children of the NRI community (or those of the Hindi-speaking foreign community) get affected.</p>

<p>Reacting to this, Aayesha Jhulka, one of the stars in the movie (that seemingly launched her career) says,</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>I can understand why Indian parents want to ban this movie.<br />However, I am totally against it because it&#8217;s one of the few movies on my Wikipedia page that has an entry darn&#8217;it!</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Education Minister of India, who prefers to remain anonymous, has reinforced that the decision is left to Pankaja Thakur, the CEO of the Censor Board of India. When we approached Mrs. Thakur, she made the following comments,</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>I know that we (The Censor Board of India) are notorious for censoring some of the most obscure things around. You know, I actually censored the two most important lines in the movie, &#8216;The Social Network&#8217;, so I could avoid giving it an &#8216;Adult&#8217; certificate and my daughter could watch it.<br />(pauses and raises hand for a high-five, to which our reporter reluctantly obliges)<br />Anyway, coming back to</em>Jo Jeeta<em>, yeah, consider it banned.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Meanwhile, the Indian intellectual community on Twitter has strongly condemned this ban, saying that banning a movie is not the Censor Board&#8217;s job anyway. In reply, Mrs. Pankaja Thakur created a Twitter account, but couldn&#8217;t manage to find a way to tweet. She then snail-mailed the following comment:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>They call themselves intellectuals. Can&#8217;t they see I&#8217;m effectively censoring the whole movie?</em></p>
</blockquote>

	<div class="post-meta">
		<div class="meta-date">January 18, 2011
	</div>
	<p>The last few months have been really, really crazy. Just look around and you can see disruption everywhere! Firstly, there were news that a viral Facebook app called threewords.me is about to be acquired just after a couple of days of launch.</p>
<p>Cheezburger network just raised 30 million dollars.&nbsp;</p>
<p>WTF DO I DOEZ WIF 30 MILLION DOLLARS?</p>
<p>Something's not quite right. The Silicon Valley has gone crazy. I can accept that a <a href="http://posterous.com">Tumblr clone</a> somehow managed to get accepted into <a href="http://ycombinator.com">YC</a>&nbsp;, but seriously, Cheezburger network raising 30 million dollars?</p>
<p>It's not just the Valley, but here in the East too.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Chinese mothers claim they're <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704111504576059713528698754.html">superior</a> at what they do (sure, if what you do is, never mind... ).</li>
<li>Pakistan is under some sort of&nbsp;<a href="http://majorlyprofound.wordpress.com/2011/01/18/birth-of-a-liberal-pakistan-approximately-after-70-years-of-screwing/">revolution</a>.</li>
<li>Tunisia has already had it's revolution. And to think of it, one suicide sparked this movement. In India, even 17000+ farmers dying a year does nothing to provoke the masses. Yet, we think of ourselves to be the most pleasant community in the world.</li>
<li>Ditto with Egypt</li>
<li>India's per-capita income is now <a href="http://devdata.worldbank.org/AAG/ind_aag.pdf">over $1000</a>&nbsp;(pdf). However, 80% of the population lives under <a href="http://www.livemint.com/articles/2007/10/16235421/80-of-Indians-live-on-less-th.html">$2 per day</a>.</li>
<li>Here in India, the onion has become one of the most prized commodities that a middle class man can be proud to own. Coming home Mr. Kumar? You can be sure to have onions in every dish, coz we ain't no poor middle-class people.</li>
<li>The fuel price hikes are bringing out the worst in motorists<em>.</em></li>
<li>The IN Congress, earlier the hallmark of democracy in India, has become a play-doll, doing nothing but holding meetings and deciding which ministers to keep on the pay-roll.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, in India, some things are still the same, and it's strangely relieving (though highly frustrating).</p>
<ul>
<li>Politicians are still siphoning off our money. Damn you fake democracy!</li>
<li>India still considers itself worthy of hosting a <a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/site/Story/126207/Sports/india-may-host-2026-fifa-world-cup-blatter.html">FIFA World Cup</a>, after what happened in the CWG (ugh!).</li>
<li>Religious people are still dying in <a href="http://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&amp;source=news&amp;cd=8&amp;ved=0CH4QqQIwBw&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dnaindia.com%2Findia%2Freport_sabarimala-stampede-tragic-memories-that-would-remain-forever_1495936&amp;ei=Qzc1TYyoOZGkugOgwKngCw&amp;usg=AFQjCNGx5-GnpSXoU5UzrhliyqOuuo-EEw&amp;sig2=PII15uwRFIIKnqXk_yPq7g">stampedes</a>. It's frikkin 2011 people!! There's something known as management! And common sense!</li>
<li>Rahul Gandhi still doesn't have any <a href="http://rahulgandhiachievements.com/">achievements</a>&nbsp;(apart from thinking he's young at 40).</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._Karunanidhi">People who cannot walk</a>, but yet find time to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._Karunanidhi#Controversies">do stuff</a>, are still running states.</li>
<li>Shah Rukh is still trying his luck at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zor_Ka_Jhatka:_Total_Wipeout">game-shows</a>&nbsp;(which is also 'inspired' by an American TV show. Seriously, can't Indians come up with anything original? )</li>
<li>Indian institutes of higher education are still deemed as elite and premier institutions.</li>
</ul>
<p>What in God's name is going on? However, I must admit, I love civic disorder! People doubting their own governments? That's what I'm talking about!</p>

	<h2><a href="http://blog.hardikr.com/startups/flipkart">Why Flipkart Rocks</a></h2>
	<div class="post-meta">
		<div class="meta-date">January 13, 2011
	</div>
	<p>Yesterday, I got this e-mail from Flipkart:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>Hello,<br /><br />We recently sent you an Availability notification for the book "Liar's Poker: The Great Powers, Yugoslavia And The Wars Of The Future" &nbsp;(<a target="_blank" href="http://www.flipkart.com/liar-poker-michel-collon-great-book-0965691667">http://www.flipkart.com/liar-poker-michel-collon-great-book-0965691667</a>) as earlier requested by you on December 14, 2010.<br /><br />Regrettably, the notification was due to an error at our end. &nbsp;The issue was fixed earlier today and needless to say, will not be repeated. Our apologies if we got your hopes up with regards to a book that you had long been waiting for. Be assured, we will continue to maintain a record of your request(s). The next time we send you an Availability email, you can be sure the book will be available for ordering.<br /><br />Sincere apologies again from all of us at Flipkart.com. Do let us know if we can be of any further assistance.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Flipkart Customer Support Team</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>I was left open-mouthed when I read this ! They're actually sending me an e-mail apologizing for <strong>getting my hopes up</strong>! Apart from providing wonderful books which I could never otherwise find in India, they have this sort of customer support.</span></p>
<p><span>This, is why Flipkart rocks. Kudos! I think you're poised for a hell of an exit when Amazon enters India and acquires you guys.</span></p>

	<h2><a href="http://blog.hardikr.com/hn/hn-classic">Hacker News Classic</a></h2>
	<div class="post-meta">
		<div class="meta-date">January 10, 2011
	</div>
	<p><strong>Hacker News Classic</strong></p>
<p>For newer members of Hacker News (like me), HN Classic is a lesser known feature. You can view it&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/classic">here</a>.</p>
<p>What is it? It shows the front-page with number of votes cast from accounts that are at least a year old. Why ? PG says, almost two years ago, in <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=607271">this submission</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>I wanted to see if there had been any visible decrease in quality. Doesn't look like it. There's surprisingly little difference between this and the regular frontpage.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even today, there doesn't seem to be much of a difference between the Classic page and the regular front page. HN probably has a really high number of lurkers, who don't bother registering/upvoting. Also, HN has been around for a long time, so a relatively higher number of accounts are older than a year. That probably dilutes the measure PG was looking for.</p>
<p><strong>Submissions with Minimum Votes</strong></p>
<p>Next, we come to the Minimum votes feature. You can view the front-page with submissions that have at least a minimum number of votes that you can specify. Example: <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/over?points=100">http://news.ycombinator.com/over?points=100</a> will return posts with minimum of 100 votes. An interesting experiment is visiting the above link, and seeing how many of the thirty you have already visited. If it's greater than 20, you can be sure you're up-to-date with the latest in tech/startup. (in fact, HN was earlier known as <em>Startup News</em>).</p>
<p><strong>Karma Thresholds</strong></p>
<p>After you reach a certain threshold ( 200-300 I think), you can edit the color of the website header. At 500 karma, you get down-voting. At a higher karma level, you can create Polls. Also, I've read somewhere that beyond a really high threshold you can even edit the text 'Hacker News' in the header !&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Hacker News Mirror</strong></p>
<p>PG hosts a mirror at <a href="http://apps.ycombinator.com/news">http://apps.ycombinator.com/news</a>&nbsp;, in case you live in a weird-ass place that's blocked news.YC .</p>
<p><strong>E-mail Notifications</strong></p>
<p>You can use Notifo to get notified when somebody responds to your thread. Just put your Notifo username in the appropriate place in your HN profile.</p>
<p><strong>Bookmarking Stories</strong></p>
<p>Ever wished you could bookmark that clever hack to use for your next project. Sure, there's Instapaper, but if you just upvote it, it'll appear in your saved stories in your profile.</p>
<p><strong>Delay your comment&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Ever posted a comment only to find out the original poster has edited his/her comment meanwhile? Use the delay field in your profile to make your comments appear after a short while.</p>
<p>That's it I guess. You probably knew most of the stuff above. If you didn't, well, now you do!</p>
