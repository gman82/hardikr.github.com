<h2>Wrong turn.</h2>
<p>The page you're trying to access does not exist.</p>
<p>If you got here by mistake, try the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/archives.html">archives</a> to find the page you're after.</p>
<p>If you got here by clicking a link on this site that's incorrect, it would be super swell if you could <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/contact.html">send me a note</a> to let me know things are broken!</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can <a href="javascript:history.go(-1);">head back</a>! </p>
