Here's the source for my coffee blog. 

Everything is gussied-up into a static site via [Jekyll][1] with some help from the [jekyll_ext][2] wrapper and several [extensions][3].

Technically, the data in the `_posts`, `img` and `photos` directories are copyrighted; however you can take and reuse whatever you like so long as you provide a source credit.
