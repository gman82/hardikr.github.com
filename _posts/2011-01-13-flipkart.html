<p>Yesterday, I got this e-mail from Flipkart:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>Hello,<br /><br />We recently sent you an Availability notification for the book "Liar's Poker: The Great Powers, Yugoslavia And The Wars Of The Future" &nbsp;(<a target="_blank" href="http://www.flipkart.com/liar-poker-michel-collon-great-book-0965691667">http://www.flipkart.com/liar-poker-michel-collon-great-book-0965691667</a>) as earlier requested by you on December 14, 2010.<br /><br />Regrettably, the notification was due to an error at our end. &nbsp;The issue was fixed earlier today and needless to say, will not be repeated. Our apologies if we got your hopes up with regards to a book that you had long been waiting for. Be assured, we will continue to maintain a record of your request(s). The next time we send you an Availability email, you can be sure the book will be available for ordering.<br /><br />Sincere apologies again from all of us at Flipkart.com. Do let us know if we can be of any further assistance.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Flipkart Customer Support Team</span></p>

<p><span>I was left open-mouthed when I read this ! They're actually sending me an e-mail apologizing for <strong>getting my hopes up</strong>! Apart from providing wonderful books which I could never otherwise find in India, they have this sort of customer support.</span></p>
<p><span>This, is why Flipkart rocks. Kudos! I think you're poised for a hell of an exit when Amazon enters India and acquires you guys.</span></p>
