<p>The last few months have been really, really crazy. Just look around and you can see disruption everywhere! Firstly, there were news that a viral Facebook app called threewords.me is about to be acquired just after a couple of days of launch.</p>
<p>Cheezburger network just raised 30 million dollars.&nbsp;</p>
<p>WTF DO I DOEZ WIF 30 MILLION DOLLARS?</p>
<p>Something's not quite right. The Silicon Valley has gone crazy. I can accept that a <a href="http://posterous.com">Tumblr clone</a> somehow managed to get accepted into <a href="http://ycombinator.com">YC</a>&nbsp;, but seriously, Cheezburger network raising 30 million dollars?</p>
<p>It's not just the Valley, but here in the East too.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Chinese mothers claim they're <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704111504576059713528698754.html">superior</a> at what they do (sure, if what you do is, never mind... ).</li>
<li>Pakistan is under some sort of&nbsp;<a href="http://majorlyprofound.wordpress.com/2011/01/18/birth-of-a-liberal-pakistan-approximately-after-70-years-of-screwing/">revolution</a>.</li>
<li>Tunisia has already had it's revolution. And to think of it, one suicide sparked this movement. In India, even 17000+ farmers dying a year does nothing to provoke the masses. Yet, we think of ourselves to be the most pleasant community in the world.</li>
<li>Ditto with Egypt</li>
<li>India's per-capita income is now <a href="http://devdata.worldbank.org/AAG/ind_aag.pdf">over $1000</a>&nbsp;(pdf). However, 80% of the population lives under <a href="http://www.livemint.com/articles/2007/10/16235421/80-of-Indians-live-on-less-th.html">$2 per day</a>.</li>
<li>Here in India, the onion has become one of the most prized commodities that a middle class man can be proud to own. Coming home Mr. Kumar? You can be sure to have onions in every dish, coz we ain't no poor middle-class people.</li>
<li>The fuel price hikes are bringing out the worst in motorists<em>.</em></li>
<li>The IN Congress, earlier the hallmark of democracy in India, has become a play-doll, doing nothing but holding meetings and deciding which ministers to keep on the pay-roll.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, in India, some things are still the same, and it's strangely relieving (though highly frustrating).</p>
<ul>
<li>Politicians are still siphoning off our money. Damn you fake democracy!</li>
<li>India still considers itself worthy of hosting a <a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/site/Story/126207/Sports/india-may-host-2026-fifa-world-cup-blatter.html">FIFA World Cup</a>, after what happened in the CWG (ugh!).</li>
<li>Religious people are still dying in <a href="http://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&amp;source=news&amp;cd=8&amp;ved=0CH4QqQIwBw&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dnaindia.com%2Findia%2Freport_sabarimala-stampede-tragic-memories-that-would-remain-forever_1495936&amp;ei=Qzc1TYyoOZGkugOgwKngCw&amp;usg=AFQjCNGx5-GnpSXoU5UzrhliyqOuuo-EEw&amp;sig2=PII15uwRFIIKnqXk_yPq7g">stampedes</a>. It's frikkin 2011 people!! There's something known as management! And common sense!</li>
<li>Rahul Gandhi still doesn't have any <a href="http://rahulgandhiachievements.com/">achievements</a>&nbsp;(apart from thinking he's young at 40).</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._Karunanidhi">People who cannot walk</a>, but yet find time to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._Karunanidhi#Controversies">do stuff</a>, are still running states.</li>
<li>Shah Rukh is still trying his luck at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zor_Ka_Jhatka:_Total_Wipeout">game-shows</a>&nbsp;(which is also 'inspired' by an American TV show. Seriously, can't Indians come up with anything original? )</li>
<li>Indian institutes of higher education are still deemed as elite and premier institutions.</li>
</ul>
<p>What in God's name is going on? However, I must admit, I love civic disorder! People doubting their own governments? That's what I'm talking about!</p>
