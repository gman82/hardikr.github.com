If you’ve ever noticed, many of the successful technologies that have
emerged over the past century, have become verbs of their own right, or
become the de-facto ‘direct object’ of an [intransitive verb][]. First
we have some of the golden oldies,

*"Call me"  
"Fax me"  
"E-mail me" / "Check my e-mail"  
"Watching TV"  
"Digg it"  *


And today, some new players that have turned proper nouns into verbs.

*"Chatting with .."  
"Google it"  
"Facebook me" / "Surfing Facebook"  
"Tweet me" / "TweetUp"  
"Dropbox the file"  
"Instapaper it"  
"Reddit it"  
"Radbox it"  *

Verbs have this strange force about them. There’s an inherent sense of
authority/action about them that tends to catch on. A psycholinguist
would definitely be in a better position to explain, if and why, verbs
are words of power.

Obviously, some technologies/products are almost incapable of becoming a
verb, say the iPhone, and it obviously doesn’t make it any less of a
success story. But, this is just something interesting to keep in mind
while marketing your product !

*Disclaimer: I write this as a marketing layman. So, don’t blame me
if you market your startup as a verb and it doesn’t work out ;)*
