Keeping in tune with my last post about [verbs][], *pulling off an
‘Egypt’* seems like a acceptable phrase that India can aspire to. Let’s
take a look at some of the causes of the Egyptian Revolution of 2011.
Let’s stack up Egypt’s problems alongside India’s (with utmost respect
towards Egypt, I know it was much worse off than India is now, but just
for the sake or argument). According to Wikipedia,

> …over a million people were protesting to demand the overthrow of the
> Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, an end to corruption and police
> repression, and democratic reforms of the political system.

Corruption: ✓  
Police Repression: ✓  
Democratic Reforms Required: ✓

> Grievances of Egyptian protesters have focused on legal and political
> issues including police brutality, state of emergency laws, lack of
> free elections and freedom of speech, and uncontrollable corruption,
> as well as economic issues including high unemployment, food price
> inflation, and low minimum wages.

Legal and political issues: ✓  
Police Brutality: ✓  
State of Emergency Laws: x  
Lack of Free Elections: ✓ (Most of the members of parliament just
inherit the posts from the previous generations of their family. I would
hardly call that free elections.)  
Lack of Freedom of Speech: ✓  
Uncontrollable Corruption: ✓  
High Unemployment: - (Admittedly, India did decently well to control the
effect of the recession.)  
Food Price Inflation: ✓  
Low Minimum Wages: ✓

Well, India has a lot of things going for it when the leaders claim that
the inflation rate is a sign of economic growth. I don’t buy it,
however. And Economics Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen doesn’t either, who
was Johnny-on-the-spot [recently][],

So, it’s not just me who agrees that this obsession of thinking that
India is actually growing is unhealthy, unfounded and unfair to the
middle and lower class, who pay taxes and die respectively.

I’ve said it over and over again, when a country cannot stop it’s
children from dying, that means something’s wrong. While we’re spending
millions on our defense research to launch [mosquito repellent
creams][], more than 2.35 million under the age of five [die][] every
year (60% of them from easily avoidable causes.) Does *anybody else* see
a problem here?

So let’s see, what options do we have to set things right? I’m actually
at a loss of words when I think about the arduous process to get
anything done from the government of India.

Let’s pull of an Egypt.
