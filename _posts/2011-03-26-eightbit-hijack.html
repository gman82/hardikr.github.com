<p>I logged into Twitter today and realized that my profile picture had got changed to an avatar I had created on <a href="http://eightbit.me">eightbit.me</a> a few days ago. That's weird! I do not remember doing such a thing!</p>
<p>My first instinct was to check whether other people who had used eightbit.me had suffered a similar fate, and around eight of the ten people I checked out on eightbit using their profile randomizer had their avatars set as their Twitter profile photo. I don't know if that proves anything or not, I'm just stating my observations.</p>
<p>I'll be the first one to admit it, I did not verify what sort of permissions eightbit demanded at the time I approved it, and I presumed it was just an interface for signing in.</p>
<p>But, it seems that they've hijacked my Twitter profile photo. What's next? It reminds me of that post on Hacker News whose title went something like 'oAuth will kill your kids'. I can't find it right now, but I really want to go back and read that article again.&nbsp;</p>
