<p><strong>Hacker News Classic</strong></p>
<p>For newer members of Hacker News (like me), HN Classic is a lesser known feature. You can view it&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/classic">here</a>.</p>
<p>What is it? It shows the front-page with number of votes cast from accounts that are at least a year old. Why ? PG says, almost two years ago, in <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=607271">this submission</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>I wanted to see if there had been any visible decrease in quality. Doesn't look like it. There's surprisingly little difference between this and the regular frontpage.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even today, there doesn't seem to be much of a difference between the Classic page and the regular front page. HN probably has a really high number of lurkers, who don't bother registering/upvoting. Also, HN has been around for a long time, so a relatively higher number of accounts are older than a year. That probably dilutes the measure PG was looking for.</p>
<p><strong>Submissions with Minimum Votes</strong></p>
<p>Next, we come to the Minimum votes feature. You can view the front-page with submissions that have at least a minimum number of votes that you can specify. Example: <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/over?points=100">http://news.ycombinator.com/over?points=100</a> will return posts with minimum of 100 votes. An interesting experiment is visiting the above link, and seeing how many of the thirty you have already visited. If it's greater than 20, you can be sure you're up-to-date with the latest in tech/startup. (in fact, HN was earlier known as <em>Startup News</em>).</p>
<p><strong>Karma Thresholds</strong></p>
<p>After you reach a certain threshold ( 200-300 I think), you can edit the color of the website header. At 500 karma, you get down-voting. At a higher karma level, you can create Polls. Also, I've read somewhere that beyond a really high threshold you can even edit the text 'Hacker News' in the header !&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Hacker News Mirror</strong></p>
<p>PG hosts a mirror at <a href="http://apps.ycombinator.com/news">http://apps.ycombinator.com/news</a>&nbsp;, in case you live in a weird-ass place that's blocked news.YC .</p>
<p><strong>E-mail Notifications</strong></p>
<p>You can use Notifo to get notified when somebody responds to your thread. Just put your Notifo username in the appropriate place in your HN profile.</p>
<p><strong>Bookmarking Stories</strong></p>
<p>Ever wished you could bookmark that clever hack to use for your next project. Sure, there's Instapaper, but if you just upvote it, it'll appear in your saved stories in your profile.</p>
<p><strong>Delay your comment&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Ever posted a comment only to find out the original poster has edited his/her comment meanwhile? Use the delay field in your profile to make your comments appear after a short while.</p>
<p>That's it I guess. You probably knew most of the stuff above. If you didn't, well, now you do!</p>
