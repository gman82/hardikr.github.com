title: Why Indian News Channes Suck
permalink: news.html
---

<p>They're the pride of the country. Each Indian news channel brands itself as the best in the country, awarded by some random media agency. The news anchors just bask in self-appointed glory, while showcasing how their news channel has helped re-shape India's present and future.</p>
<p>Bull.</p>
<p>Indian news channels suck, for more reason than one. First, they have set themselves on such high pedestals, that they really need to look around and realize what they actually are. Just a bunch of people repeating the same stuff over and over again. It's not that there are no news left to report, but it's just that they're not good enough.</p>
<p>Someone who watches an Indian news channel as his/her sole source of information about the outside world is no better than the ones who watch reality TV programs like Roadies, Bigg Boss etc. Why? That's because the objective of both these classes of programs are the same - feast on the gossip-hungriness, anxiety and naivety of the public.</p>
<p>Second, they don't actually show any newsworthy news. If you read one issue of The Economist, I'll bet you wouldn't have heard of a single news article from the Indian media. Why ? Beats me ! Apparently, an actor commenting on another actor's movie is more newsworthy than events that may define the world's future.</p>
<p>Third, they're biased. When a politician's oh-so-cowardly act of accepting a bribe is exposed, there'll be 12 hour specials covering it. But when certain news personalities are out lobbying, its quietly brushed aside without so much as a mention. The fact that news items are 'sold' is not too hard to catch - especially in the newspapers. One quick glance at the front page of a major newspaper shows a new talk-time plan by a major telecom company. Front page news? Seems so.</p>
<p>One quick recommendation would be, switch off that idiot box and get online, where you can read the real 'news' , if you even know what that means any more. Quality journalism comes at a cost. You have to be unbiased, fair, objective and straightforward no matter what the news item may be. It sounds easy, but it's quite Herculean to say the least. That's probably why we don't have a single proper news channel in the country.</p>---
