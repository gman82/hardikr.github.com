<pre><em>(Last Revision : 18th October, 2010)</em></pre>
<p>This was the comment policy on my <a href="http://hardik988.wordpress.com">old blog</a>.&nbsp;This blog has comments turned off to avoid normal people turning into trolls. However, if you wish to have a mature conversation about anything I write, contact me by clicking&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.hardikr.com/contact">here!</a>.</p>
<p>1. Never leave your e-mail ID in the comment field. Most blogs have a separate field for the same purpose. Use it.</p>
<p>2. Don't comment if you don't have anything constructive to say to the author. Spare your rants for your own blog.</p>
<p>3.  Try to be as grammatically correct as possible. Use complete and  coherent sentences. If English is not your native language, work on  improving your English.</p>
<p>4. Spare the profanity! Even if you're the  author's best-bud from college, you don't need to indulge in  name-calling. Additionally, <a target="_blank" href="http://gothamist.com/2010/10/15/court_orders_google_to_reveal_comme.php">you may get sued.</a></p>
<p>5. Follow the comment policy of the blog. If you do, there's a good chance you'll get a reply from  the author. If there's no comment policy, observe the pattern of how the  author responds to comments. Try obtaining cues from the comments he  responded to..</p>
<p>6. If the author responds to your comment, it <strong>DOES NOT</strong> give you the license to hunt him down on Facebook and add him as a friend. Though you're always welcome to <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/hardikr">follow him</a>.</p>
<p>7. If the author is a celeb, spare the 'fan-boy' comment. It's not the time or the place. There are <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/">other channels</a> suited for the same purpose.</p>
<p>8. Never EVER ask the author to do any chores for you - eg:   e-mail you (unless you happen to know him really well). There's a good  chance he will not bother.</p>
<p>9. Preview your comment before you hit 'Submit!'.</p>
<p>10.  There is a secret to make your comment come across as insightful and  wise, even if you don't know squat about what is being talked about.  Find that secret and use it wisely. ( Hint: Secret != using  sesquipedalian words )</p>
<p>11. Don't <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll_%28Internet%29">Troll</a>. Don't Spam. Both are equally bad.</p>
<p>12.  Don't shamelessly self-promote your website/blog/product/service.  Instead use the comment to build a relationship with the author.</p>
